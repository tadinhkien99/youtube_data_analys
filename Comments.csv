"There's a crusaders king 2 mod called Elder kings 2 that turns the world into the Elder scrolls world 1-2 decades before elder scrolls online. It's extremely in-depth, and rather fun."
"The problem with ""be careful what you sign"" is that you LITERALLY can't use anything without having signed some form of EULA or ToS or agreement of some shitty variety. The world is full of legal jargon and bullshittery to ""protect my well padded pocket"". 

I have never, in my life, found something that I could use by declining the EULA or ToS. And you know the real kicker? You pay for the fucking thing before you ever even get close to being able to read the EULA/ToS/bullshit. That's the kicker for me.

That's all I have to say for my Dyanosis segment."

"the no hurtcam mod and does stuff are now a feature in minecraft and you can stabilise it super cool now i can do that instead of downloading hacks, and viruses"
"i'm not sure about this one. the idea of 'trusting' a game review at all seems kinda weird to me. it's not like a review can be right or wrong, it's just what the reviewer thinks. they may be lying about what their opinion is but really the only person who can know that for sure is themselves. i don't really see the point in using reviews as advice for whether you should buy a game or not. as you point out i think the best way to do that is to watch some videos or streams of it. to me i'd only watch a review if the review is made by someone i like and i'm interested to hear their opinion"
"No Gears 6 is absolutely ridiculous, The Coalition have been turned into a Unreal 5 clean-up team for other IP's. Sad state of affairs for Gears fans, huge letdown Xbox!"

The real question is who even asked for a LOTR game about Gollum? Like who even asked for this game in the first place?
It is crazy how far entertainment has come.
"i didnt find this game very enjoyable. for the most part, if it wasnt disturbing enough it sure as hell was boring. you wake up on an alien planet, no idea who or what you are, or how long youve been like that. theres no memos to read so you never really figure out the situation. and in the end your taken over by some parasitic creature then your possibly forever bound to a spot then the game ends.

IMO, this whole game was a waste of time. not that i ever played it myself, but watching the gameplay alone was enough for me. i dont see any need for a sequel"
"Unity n Origins Vibes 
Hopefully we get a combat for unity into mirage"
"Love those Dune editions. Halfway through a first read of Dune and it might be blasphemous to say, but I love being able to put the faces to the names. Such a faithful telling in the movie so no surprise you loved it. Recently finished Iron Gold, and Misery!"

Cheesing has been around since street fighter 2
"I tend to share many of your views on how games are structured, but my internal dialogue is full of those very unhelpful expletives you mentioned. Your thoughtful and reasoned explanations help me sort out some of my own ideas about a game, as opposed to heated reviews that just serve to reinforce a negative mindset"

Best gaming news show. Thanks Jesse!
You have too much ads
"With mods to enhance the gameplay you get more longetivity, because the community can create more content. This is why some decade-old games are still played or have been fully conversed to other type of games.  Now this game has a future."
Sony aggressively pursues cloud.
"How do you deal with the moronic players that throw everything at you as a revenge gesture, for example for exploiting a hole in their defence before they become too powerful, even if that will have them lose the game in the end?"

We need to make it clear that if they're going to support cloud gaming that they are going to lose financially. We need to fight back aggressively. We need to show them that we will not be bullied. We have a right to play our games without an internet connection and regardless of whether they want us to play these games after they have fallen out of favor or not. We will not be beholden to their shity server infrastructure. Nobody should have to be connected to the internet to play single-player game.
"I'm not a professional gamer and I'm not very good at games like most of you probably are, but I want to play such a game that contains strategy, medievalism, war, construction of buildings. The most important thing is that I am looking for such a game that I can play offline without having to spend money to buy everything I need, if there is such a thing please help me! I remember when I was little I played Warcraft 2 and there I could build all the things without money, I also like Stronghold Kingdoms but it's also about money. I hope that you community of professional players will help me, thank you in advance! A good day!"
"Really can't understand how people can get hyped up over an MMO when all we have seen is one promo a few minutes long, and this is just another in a growing list. This screams mobile game to me with fairly uninteresting-looking combat IMO. Will just forget about it until some real information is released like all the rest."
I got with the channel when you did the far cry 3 video with the shark hunting and I have to say you have dropped some absolute bangers of videos and keep up the great work and I am ready to see what you have in store for the future. I know this is super late but this is one of my favorite series you have a done

"To be honest I'm not feeling it. Nothing screams ""BUY ME!!!"" in this gameplay. I'm not seeing much progress or innovation, if anything this feels like a few steps backwards. I'm not excited for the story or setting, feels more ""been there, done that"" instead of new and exciting. Might pick it up on sale at some point but definitely not a day one purchase like many of the previous ACs were.

Feels like I'm just about done with the franchise."
"I hope this gets ported, i would love to play this again"
I know a game that you can play as an animal you have played the game it's called ancestors the humankind odeecy

"This is how I see the entire situation
Critics USED to have the definition of: ""A person with skills and experience on a certain subject""
But now
Critics have the definiteion of: ""A random person that claims to know more than the rest""

I think actual PhD's and licenses need to be made cuz now you can just log onto the website, convince everyone you're a critic and claim to know more than others.
Not just with games, also with movies and food.
Better yet, remove critics, they're full of bias, they promote the games they like and bash on the games they don't like."

"I am grateful that I'm so tired of modern Blizzard that I have no desire to play the new Diablo. Which is batshit crazy to me since it's one of my all time favorite series. I don't know how more people aren't of the same mind, but here we are. Go enjoy it, but I get all my Blizzard entertainment from the constant train-wrecks and resulting garbage fires thanks to Activision's corpo mishandlings."

"I think, like you mentioned the Digital License route would be the best Utility for games and software, for the customer at least with being able to resell, borrow, rent your digital license 2nd hand. 

There are already systems in place and use in NFTs that allows the original creator to make a small percentage of each resell of an NFT so the developers publishers could get a 2-3% Royalty with each resell or 2nd hand rent, just like running the market place this would give them healthy long term passive income.

The problem is the vast majority of the NFT market are just opportunists, greedy business folk and people looking for a quick buck, which ends up poisoning the well on what NFTs could actually be used for. Who knows if it will ever clean up, because actually being able to own, resell, borrow etc. our digital games and software would be fantastic."
Returnal rip off
Good thing I dont really use my MOC.. I do a lot of grinding that doesnt really involve it

Can you change character from male to female if you want it or the opposite? It would be cool. And does Cyberpunk has online multiplayer?

"With the Nadia ammo box clip was there actually an item box there or possibly to have been dropped there for her to hear? In the clip she aims at the wall and shoots and it looks like there is a crate there which Im not sure if that is the mentioned box. If it is that doesn't work since the box is already there and the person is outside the window already meaning that in the half second between her entering the room and her turning to that corner the other player had thrown that box there and had soundlessly ran out of the room and onto the balcony outside.
If not had it been confirmed that the player had dropped an ammo box at all?"

The full refund Google gave for the hardware and the games is very suggestive that they do not plan on doing anything else with it; including releasing a firmware update for the controllers to unlock the wireless functionality. Oh well."
Can someone help me what is the game at 25:08?

You donâ€™t understand. The game is the way it should be. You can mod it however you want to. The game is about building youâ€™re own experience and what is best than a futuristic mod accessible game than this. I mean is a win win. Everyone could play it the way they want to. If it wasnâ€™t because of the mods everyone wouldâ€™ve been playing the exact same game.

The best version is the online capture the fort games. The tactics reguarding siege warefare apply to these games. Also the forts are 2 to 4 times as hard to capture as a regular territory.
cant wait until we get to a place where we dont even think about develop games for consoles
"W No way. This game have so few abilities options, level scaling that just make the leveling more boring. It's not making the game harder, it's just making it slower and doesn't require any skills. 
ARPG games are suppose to be hard and give u options to customize spells. boring game"

There is also a cayo glitch where u get aggressor loadout no matter what and if u restart just once ur left with no weapons so yeah itâ€™s kinda confirmed in my opinion that this is sabotage committed by an R* employeeâ€¦ no way these are all accidentsâ€¦ I want this employee to face at least 5+ years in prison because letâ€™s just think of all the vehicles lost due to this glitchâ€¦ the value of every vehicle lost is prob in the billions or trillion (in gta $ obv) which amounts to 1000s upon 1000s of irl dollars if u use megladon shark card conversion rateâ€¦

I feel like I've been seeing pre-release footage of games like this for like 20 years now and NONE of them lived up to the hype. What they are trying to achieve is just too big.

"Evil Genius 2 is a good game, but it gets old quickly. Even on the hardest difficulty, you can just ""camp"" the areas the enemies come in, and the game's challenge fades away. You'll find yourself just fast forwarding through most of the game until you eventually win."

"The game has only one planet in reality. Every planet is just a rehash of the last using the exact same format with only basic random asset  changes and a texture change. There's nothing to explore on any planet other than the same types of asset groups.

The content is filler, all of it. The base building was just an add in. It's shallow and does not effect your game in any way. 
Every derelict is identical. Every base is identical, every building is identical.

"The game was a disappointment and a missed opportunity. The studio Daedalic Entertainment could have made a storybook point and click adventure like they did with Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth. There they adapted the novel Pillars of the Earth and gave you the chance to change the story based on your own decisions. Pillars of the Earth also had great animation and voice acting.
Imagine having a Gollum game where you get to play through the events of LOTR but make choices that could change the story. Smeagol could regain his goodness and be saved. Or Gollum could triumph and kill the hobbits and take the ring. However, LOTR Gollum ending up just being a bad climbing and stealth game where the players choices have no meaning"

"Here is a tip for any equipment you might try to buy when starting out (audio recording, headphones, cameras, etc); BUY THE LOW END. DO NOT LOOK UP RECOMMENDED STUFF WHEN STARTING OUT.
 You need to learn what you need when making content, going all out at or even mid-tier at the start is always a bad idea. Start with cheap material and make crappy content a while and learn what to upgrade over time. You learn as you go."

"One of the few guys in the retro game scene with good humor. I was just wondering if there are any 80's peeps out there that just started collecting for these 8/16/32 bit machines. People start to collect the things first they sold when they were young. Then you get the games you've rented/played with friends that you liked but never had. Then you see these awesome games that you played through an emulator that you want to have in original form. Then OCD kicks in and you want to have these games complete and you start to upgrade those carts with better ones. Before you know it, you became a retro game collector."
That's the problem with making making games from books and movies. The events already happened the only things you can truly do to stay loyal to the story is battle

"Well ANY game COULD be produced to run at 60fps?  Most developers just decide to prioritize Graphical 'embellishments' or features like Ray Tracing, instead of REDUCING the visual fidelity of their game to run at 60fps...
Do people not understand this?  Do you want 720p running at 60fps, or 4k running at 30fps?  It's up to the developer on what they want to focus on."

Completely depends on the TV try playing 30fps on a high end OLED display because of the sample & hold tech of the TV 30fps looks absolutely horrendous 40FPS on a 120hz TV is actually very good compromise starfield would be able to do 40FPS no problem

"100% agree. If a game plays with a terribly uneven frame pace, and stutters, it ruins the games. 

The only thing I think would be an issue is, like survivor, the game launched totally broken, but they released a patch almost day 1... or 2.... and fixed alot of the issues across the board. 

Maybe have a caveat like, if they iron out the framerate, then the game will score x. If not, it will remain x."

"The Atlanta Falcons have been busy during the 2023 NFL draft, selecting several promising players to bolster their roster. With a mix of offensive and defensive picks, the Falcons are looking to improve on their record from last season and make a push for the playoffs.

First Round Pick: Offensive Tackle

The Falcons used their first-round pick to select an offensive tackle, addressing a position of need for the team. The player they selected is known for his size and strength, which should help protect the quarterback and improve the team's running game.

Second and Third Round Picks: Defensive Players

In the second and third rounds, the Falcons focused on improving their defense. They selected a linebacker and a defensive end, both of whom are known for their speed and athleticism. The Falcons hope these players will help them improve their pass rush and limit their opponents' scoring.

Fourth Round Pick: Wide Receiver

The Falcons added some depth to their receiving corps with their fourth-round pick. The player they selected is known for his speed and agility, which should make him a valuable asset in the team's passing game.

Fifth and Sixth Round Picks: Offensive Players

In the fifth and sixth rounds, the Falcons added two more players to their offense. They selected a running back and a tight end, both of whom are known for their versatility and ability to make plays. The Falcons hope these players will help them improve their running game and give the quarterback more options in the passing game.

Seventh Round Pick: Defensive Tackle

The Falcons used their final pick of the draft to select a defensive tackle. The player they selected is known for his size and strength, which should help the team improve its run defense. The Falcons hope this player will be a valuable asset in stopping their opponents' running game.

Overall, the Falcons had a successful draft, adding several promising players to their roster. With a mix of offensive and defensive picks, the team is looking to improve on last season's record and make a push for the playoffs. Only time will tell if these draft picks will pan out, but the Falcons are hopeful that they have added some valuable assets to their team."

"Gotta make me a Mahomes shirt that says ""I'm Like That""...Gangster AF!"
A strong economy is the source of national strength
Mariota doesnâ€™t fit thisâ€¦. Would have rather seen any other QB
I see some falcons fans mad about Mariota supposedly quitting on the teamâ€¦ but not mad that the franchise has been making bad decisions since that embarrassing SB loss to the Pats.
please explain the reason for this documentary on Quarterback

What a great job have you done smiling boy !!! Thank you.

"It's called pressure and now it's gone, good on him."
Proud to be a Manchester city fan ðŸ’™ðŸ’™
grealish is like he is rapping
Thnx a lot for going to this stadium again . It's a world class stadium
4:26 you can see Newcastle United player after we lost in league Cup  in 1976
This was the last time he was seen sober
Grealish is the most annoying but humble guy man
God I wish he signed for united
this is brilliant Liam!
What has happened to Yeovil over the last few years? League One only a few years ago now fallen out of the Conference. Crazy!
"City.......CITY.......the best team in north west and all the world ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜ðŸ™ƒðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‰ðŸ’™CTID.
Thanks for the tour, from a City fan in excile for 5 years in the Philippines ðŸ˜‰ðŸ‘ðŸ¼."
What a muppet
"Amazing.. City fan from India...
One day I'll be there sure... waiting..."
He really did step up his game after the World Cup
Henry oozing sauce and class
It's insane how much of a players game is mental. Way more than you would think.
Overrated
Heâ€™s a shadow of the player he was at Aston Villa.
Oilchester city
NBA world can learn a few things from this interview. Regarding media and Jokic.
Wow beautiful stadium main stadium academy practice grounds indoor practicing all in one roof â˜ºï¸ðŸ‘Œ
I'm an honest man... Scored a decisive goal with hand against Ireland ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸
"The City would have won it without him, thank to Halland, someone had to say it"
"Grealish.
He's just a normal bloke.
Like any one of us.
An ordinary bloke living and working in an extraordinary environment.
He cannot hide his down to earth roots and that's why many supporters like him-even non Man City fans."
both class acts right there
Delli Ali kicking himself so hard after watching this
Attention seeker and mercenary
This is so genuine we need more
thank you for remind me subscribe and 1 like for you
The price they pay for them must be such a burden
St James' Park in the near future will be more beautiful and bigger
"Thanks for the informative video, I can't wait to have the tour as well ðŸ™ðŸ½â¤ï¸"
This club is so plastic it brings me out in a rash - not a fan.
More interviews needs to be like this instead of jargon.
He didnâ€™t look back and he just wanted go forward â¤ thatâ€™s the turning point
he is not worth of 100m to be sure
This is amazing well done Liam thank u for your hard workðŸ’šðŸ’š
100m waste to  World'class Winger Journey â¤ï¸â¤ï¸
Even this season also he didn't do anything...
Looks a bit old. They need a refurbishment.
Wish we could see a a player haha
Can you do a Stadium Tour at Stokes Bet 365 Stadium Please
When is the next episode coming out
His very very good nowâ€¦ still not worth 100 mill. Love his personality though
Come back to the villa we playing in Europe this season ðŸ˜…
league 2 coming soon
"Great piece Liam, enjoyed that.ðŸ’š"
Wish he had more game time during the world cup
"Lol I still have doubts, what does he actually contribute?"
I wanted to watch the video to see what it was like because I am going tomorrow from this moment in time and I am so excited thank you Rob
"NEO QUÃMICA, CORINTHIANS STADIUM IS THE BEST !"
"He's still an average player not worth 100 m foe sure , more like half of it"
Crazy how when he was playing for villa years ago he was so hated and now everyone loves himðŸ˜‚
Take dat as a big compilment jack you deserve it
"Gotta love that Keira knightly havenâ€™t ya, pure class she is"
"Honest man indeed... some pundits, we all know who... will have been sucking him off ðŸ˜‚"
"Not only is his dribbling good, i love the way he track back players during counter attack. He can defend just as good as he can dribble."
Just did the tour yes2day was brilliant
"Will you do wolves,everton,burley,Brentford,lester and many more stadium will you do any of them in the future?"
well it didnt ' achieve by unity '
that self realization is something ALL professional footballers need to have. Too many players have gone downhill because of the salary which naturally leads to ego and arrogance. One of the best examples i can shoot out is Mbappe. Dude won the world cup so early in life and is now just a tool. 24 years old i think. Good on Grealish. Wish more footballers mature like this.
Great vid mate I visited in 2007 a lot has changed since then haha :)
Most people would have been offended with Henryâ€™s honesty. Jack is a great character alongside being a talented footballer.
The British accent is ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
"I went there today, it was awesome!"
Ive always wanted to hate Jack Grealish because he enforced that stereotype of good looking dumb as rocks footballerd who never had to try in life but honestly hes one of my favorite players now because of how genuine and positive he is. Much deserved Jack
Silly and childish haircut lad haha
Speaks better English than Harry Kane
'I'm an honest man Henry'. His lack of honesty following his handball against Ireland in 2009 will never be forgotten.
Why doesnâ€™t he say it in English
From a Dorking Fan - Well done Liam. This is class mate. Love the angles and narration. Keep it up!!
Henry has better hair than Grealish.
If every player that United bought for overpriced amount thinked like Jack we would have been champions.
Foden is levels above Grealish
CORINTHIANS HAS THE BEST STADIUM IN THE WORLD !
Did this tour last week as a surprise for my son. He loved it.
Really enjoyable watch. Looking fwd to part 2ðŸ‘ðŸ»
Here after City trashed United 4x1 ðŸ˜‚
God i love these vidoes lad
Someone AI clone Maguire's face and voice over Jack. That would be gold!
Just a typical English Blair he's probably played one good game and then he's going to be Garvey for rest of his life just like any other freaking stupid English player
"Ace this, from a Grimsby fan. Love JMD for what he did for us at the play-offs."
Respect to both!
Class ðŸ™ŒðŸ½
So many honest players play for at the dishonest club ever. Sad
Love it! Will need to get down and do a video soon...
They should add Yaya toure fan favorite
having thiery hold your arm must be one of the best feelings ever
You should do a stadium tour outside of UK
Honest man???? Lol did he score with his hand and took another country spot in the world cup....this guys a ðŸ¤¡
well done mate what a watch
Grealish > Totti
Should've been used more for England
"He left Villa, only to lift the UCL in Villa colours."
"Be interesting to see how Newcastle go about their transformation. With City and the Etihad, its located in a place that at the time of the takeover, was a part of Manchester just outside the centre that was just forgotten about. Ex industrial with random council estates and large wastelands. Perfect for a visionary (with a large bank balance). The training ground and academy is something else. To think our takeover may never have happened if we were still at Maine Road in 2008"
I couldn't wait for success... so I went ahead without it. â¤â¤
Old Trafford tour 2022
I wish I was there already! ðŸ˜­
"And them PSG fans booed Messi ðŸ¤¦ðŸ½â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦ðŸ½â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦ðŸ½â€â™‚ï¸ incredible, definitely will be remembered as the worst football fans"
â€œOur Documentary is better than yoursâ€ how cringe ðŸ˜‚ He does a good job of trying to be Marc White he must have a crush on him
No clue how this man starts ahead of Mahrez. Riyad is so much better.
"First Dorking, now Yeovil, still baffles me how players at this level can be so poor, at least Dorking try to  play football, no wonder that stayed up, they at least have some strengths, ie they can score goals"
Grealish is new Gascoigne but smarter and under Pep
BIG JACK GREEEAAALLLIISSHHH ENJOY IT BROTHER YOU HAVE GROWN INTO A TOP DRAW PLAYER â¤
Haha the match experience.... And there are empty seats lol
"The whole video was ruined when you shown  a place card with ""the Sun"" written on it!

Dont buy the Sun

COYBs UTFTs"
Pick Chris Paul to be on the Denver Nuggets he deserves to win a championship to.
Why is bro always eating or drinking smth during his interviews ðŸ˜‚
Love couch Malone celebrating with a big Ultra....Salud!
Bro treating this like a 9-5 job. Canâ€™t wait to go on vacation.
Just wow!!
"Great respect for Coach Malone.
Bringing all peaces in perfect harmony.
Keep going Mr Malone,dynasty must role forward for years."
"After the Heats won game 2, Jimmy wore a t-shirt saying ""Thrree MORE"". I wonder what his t-shirt is saying now?  I think ""No MORE"" hahaha."
"Aaron needs to play MORE AGGRESSIVE. he is too soft when he is playing.  If Aaron starts to play aggressive, he is a Beast."
CHAMPIANS?
You earned every bit of it bro ðŸ‘
NBA DUM BOY played Jalen. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
"I've never heard any of the players before these players of today cry about playing back to back games.. You signed a contract to play an 82 Game season.. The are robbing the people who pays for these damn tickets and there salaries and y'all want to cry about playing... I've never heard Mike, Magic,Bird, Isaiah, Rodman,Patrick,Duncan,The Admiral complain about playing a whole damn season..."
AG Faded !ðŸ¾ðŸ¥´
Anybody can change the game if you can make every shot you can change the game ðŸŽ® that announcer might as well be Stephen Curry 2 Tyrek Evans nowhere close to Curry or Kyrie now
They should trade jimmy and someone else and try to acquire dame I think dame could give heat another shot at a ring
They sucked
Coach Malone pounding the Michelob Bottle during the press conference is ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜
Bill Russell would have been so happy to see this man win a championship.
A great win for franchise and the city of Denver. Being a Heat fan yes I hate losing but we have to recognize greatness and truly they were the better team as coach Spo said in his interview. Dynasties come and go and I believe the Nuggets will be dominant for years to come. Congrats to coach Malone and the Nuggets and congrats to my Heat team because they defied the naysayers and though they fell short they will only become stronger because of it.....Go Heat
Jokic seems like the type of dude to call his NBA career his side hobby lmao
Lets all take a moment to reflect about the fact that Deondre Jordan is a champ before CP3. nice.
"""Can you describe the emotions you're feeling?""
""I feel good.""
""What does this amazing accomplishment feel like?""
""Good."""
"I'm tired of people saying he's not athletic. He's more than athletic, playing 42+ minutes and running the fastbreaks. He's just not explosive. Athletic and explosive are not the same.
And it's his lack of explosiveness that makes him see plays before they happen. He doesn't rush things. 
His passing abilities come from European (ex-Yugoslavian) school of basketball that makes kids learn the fundamentals. Regardless of position. 
The results are JokiÄ‡, DonÄiÄ‡, KukoÄ‡, RaÄ‘a, Divac, PetroviÄ‡ and the rest."
tearsâ¤â¤gonna get that allstar status next yr
Mike mike mike- heâ€™s a good coach
"This is one of boring  ðŸ†  I can say nuggets  are so lucky to play against  8 seeded miami heat, so boring, finals  should played between  2 best teams in the nba not jimmy  butler  miami heat, last time I enjoy finals was bucks vs  suns, golden state vs raptors,  to 2016 cavs"
Jokic is hilarious i hope he gets more comfortable talking with the media because if he just lets himself say whatever he wants it would be incredible
stephen is too good bru..
They need to keep the team together.
I know heâ€™s feeling just like Klay Thompson felt when he won after coming back from injuries.
Keep laughing as a Steph curry fan when we was up 3-1 In the finals I made that same mistake I celebrated already 3-1 leads never safe
"Bruce Brown, Boston legend"
"This is pure love, no one talks about themselves like other made up â€œstarsâ€ promoting brands promoting themselves, love this , love this !"
Sociopath.
"Jimmy butler overrated ass. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Youâ€™ll never win a ring bum ass nigga"
"MpJ was great on bds tonight - 13 ! Plus the inside scoring, 6/11."
Klay Thompson is a very good guy ðŸŽ‰
Lol heat is absolutely rigged team is trash
One of the greatest 8yr coaching job in nva history
I barely understand him cause he speaks Russian ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜¢
"Bruce Brown, DeAndre and Jeff Green got a ring before Harden.ðŸ˜‚"
Coach Malone is such an underrated coach been saying that for yrs so happy for him that he is now a champion as a head coach and to win the first ring for a franchise makes it that much better salute coach
Jamal also good ...btw Jokic at 6.11 whats his wingspan?I guess around 7.3...
What about sabonis senior
Maybe you guys can win it all next season.
I love her jimmy buckets is showing so much enthusiasm of being there for the reporters he could Cara rats ass about congratulating the Nuggets same thing goes for the butcher Lowery
Breathing techniques wooo hoooo
You are looking at the BEST coach in the NBA<>Coach Michael Malone<>Standing O
"Remember the only people who saw potential on curry back in 2009
Skip Bayless
Knicks fans"
This moron didn't learn a thing.
"Soplstra was the better coach

Malone just got lucky because he got Jokic

But Spolstra was the better coach

ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
I wrote down everything Ja said. I used the paper to blow my nose.
How about make a documentary on like the Sacremento Kings during the Lakers Reign.
Congrats to the Nuggets on winning the NBA championship for the first time ever. You guys waited over 40 decades to get to this moment and as an avid Lakers fan here I'm so happy for you guys. Congrats on MPJ on this biggest milestone. People forget he was supposed to be the #1 pick before his back problem cost his draft stock to fell at the end of the lottery but now you're an NBA champion and I'm so happy for you.
He's a slightly more charismatic version of Tim Duncan from a personality perspective.
"Jalen, really sat there and allow JA to play in his face like that?!? I'd be so disappointed cause he really went out on a limb for him to assist in cleaning up his image. We DON'T want or need a Part 2ðŸ™„"
"What a wonderful and professional approach to the end of a great run. I do hope Jimmy gets a ring, because much like Karl Malone + John Stockton, and company, he deserves a ring. He may never get one, but Butler always plays like a champion, as does Kyle Lowery."
Let's go Warriors.
This doc looks like bored films doc
Now inmagine if he did go to the knicksðŸ˜®
16 points 13 boards in a defensive battle championship clinch game is nothing to sneeze at. Maybe it wasnâ€™t his best game but it was definitely an above average game for most of the league.
Just re-up this video in a few weeks
"I do respect his humbleness, but I'm sure at some point if he's not going to celebrate with his team, he's definitely going to celebrate Serbian style with his 2 older brothers."
Stephen Curry: The GOD of Shooting the Basketball ðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥
"All Jimmy has to do is team up with dbook and kd, then they goin have a couple chips Fs ðŸ˜"
Deserve Michael Malone he is a Great coach God bless brother in Jesus nameðŸ™ðŸ”¥ðŸ‘ŒðŸ†
add dame lilliard to this line up for herro and there in a very strong position for a championship next year

Will he be fired if they don't repeat?
Hi is smart.  He answers the questions well.

"Minute 3:00, he pulled the Joker ðŸƒ out and nobody noticed!!! Thatâ€™s funny ðŸ¤£ðŸ¥²ðŸ˜‚"
"""ðŸ˜ No! I need to go home."""
"I've seen some throw away plays throughout the NBA Finals by Butler; so watch the tapes of all 5 games, and I'm sure you'll see Butler throwing away games like he had a huge wager in Vegas... That is why I hated they legalized sports betting.... The Nuggets would've won, I believe< regardless; but in a game 7... Butler was too obvious not playing, not gaurding, throwing away passes, and shooting rediculous shots..."
"Never, never put Hall of fame and Butler in the same sentence. He is not a 1st team nor 2nd team all-star. Maybe 3rd if he isn't dirty player because he is.  He flops that idiot Refs buy."
We are proud to fuel the Nuggets! Enjoy that aÃ§aÃ­ bowl Jamal :)
Can't emphasize enough about how happy i am for Jamal. What an inspirational story â¤
Got my ðŸ’° money. Thanks  ðŸ”« ðŸ”«
Congrats Post Malone
"I don't know who's more ispirational, if Jokic or Mike Malone

I love listening to him
Remembering all his coaches since highschool really touched me

and it's evident he loves stats 
"" how many?"" ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…"
This MAN did a good job with this team this season  congratulations  coach ðŸ‘ ðŸ™Œ ðŸ’ª ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ’¯
"Jimmy is the best Leader this game has ever seen 
He builds his teammates up 
He always give them credit 
He takes accountability 
He doesnâ€™t boast about himself 
He doesnâ€™t make excuses"
What's the next BS interview going to be like lol ðŸ˜†
Im glad that he reflect on his action
Awesome ðŸ‘Œ he let his game do the trash talking ðŸ‘„
"His family must be so embarrassed.  If not, they should be."

Please!!! Keep the same guys on this team!!!
"I could not be more grateful to these guys. 19+ years being a part of Nugget Nation, wishing and hoping for a *good* team.....and we wind up with the absolute greatest group of guys imaginable. Humble, kind, good to their fans, and loyal to each other. I wish we could find a way to keep Bruce Brown, so badly. Seeing anyone on this team leave would break my heart."
What a post chip interview
The softest and weakest NBA championship team is history ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦
Told people 2 years ago if Denver had Murray they woulda been 3 time champs
A diamond in the ruff is an understatement when it comes to Jokic and his journey not just in the NBA but his life in general.  I say bring that trophy to Serbia.
the joy of the Beer Sponsor - if he could just.... Align the bottle/logo .
"He literally looks distressed. Asking where is his support. And he wants to go home.

Then you realise heâ€™s thousands of miles from home. Thousands of miles from the people whoâ€™ve supported him and who he loves.

What a human guy."
"Good documentary, only the noise is bothering when you record"
George Karl walked so Michael Malone could run.
Wilt averaged 8.6 assists one year.
Jokic a goat human being
Coach needs to relax with that dynasty crap....When ever I hear that word especially from someone who has no clue I cringe.  He's begging to sound like that idiot Dillion Brooks. You just won one chip in 100 years calm down..I would be saying the same thing if he was my team's coach. But I can't say that because my team is a dynasty...LOL..
"Coach Malone, youâ€™re phenomenal! Respect!"
can't wait for the upcoming Ja Morant expulsion sentence
The complete opposite of JA BORAT ðŸ¤£
"Mans said â€œI donâ€™t know whatâ€™s up with my jump shot but I donâ€™t care, Iâ€™ll fix it in the off-season.â€ ðŸ˜‚ Keep it real.  Owned up to it.  Love it."
well this interview  didn't age well
As long as Gordon DOESNT'T do a rap video about winning the chip I'm content. ðŸ˜‚
From play in bro
Ain't learn ðŸ’© ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
"he has really come into his own, i like it!"
"If you wanna say he's young, how many NBA superstars coming to the league much younger than him,did they do what Ja do?ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ flashing gun?"
MPJ NBA CHAMPION
Itâ€™s the ultra for me
Micheal Malone looks llike he is happy
"You can tell that Mike Malone cares about his players. It's extremely important for any organization to have a leader who cares about the people in the organization. This team has a lot of talent, but it also has management that sets a very strong example for everyone on the team.

The team also has players who have very strong winning attitudes. The guys help each other out. They support each other. They don't throw each other under the bus. All the guys on the team have really good attitudes. That includes MPJ, Gordon, KCP, Bruce Brown, Christian Braun, Jamal, Jokic, etc. The guys really do work hard, don't feel sorry for themselves, and work to stay focused. I think it helps a lot that Jokic has a very strong work ethic and Murray is very competitive and determined. There are several guys who hustle very hard on defense, and they've lifted the defensive standards that every guy on the team sets for themselves.

Denver will be a top team in the NBA for years unless they get unlucky with injuries."
"Such an incredible humble guy. I have an office in Belgrado, Serbia since 2008 and I have got to know their culture, their values and the people of Serbia are just awesome."
And the counseling didnâ€™t work. A $100 million man at the age of 23 canâ€™t be counseled ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
I LOVE YOU ALL GREAT RUN MY BABIEZ......SEE U NEXT YR GOD WILLING......
First time I heard of a Top superstar player who openly said He doesn't like his job but still gave the city a ring!ðŸ¤£
He keep the same energy the whole entire time too
"Jokic just kept showing, and finished showing, why and how heâ€™s the true MVP ðŸ’¯ðŸ˜Ž Coach, Malone is great and Iâ€™m glad he got this chip as the head coach ðŸ’¯ Screw all the haters, and I hope they learn from this and grow from
It ðŸ˜Ž"
"Charles Barkley: I guess Pat Riley never told you about your father. 

Jimmy Butler: He told me enough. He said you were jealous of Michael Jordan because when you played in the league he was more popular than you. You ruined my father. 

Charles Barkley: No. I'm your father. 

Jimmy Butler: No! That's impossible. The internet said I was Michael Jordan's son! 

Charles Barkley: Search your statistics on Google and you'll know it to be true. 

Jimmy Butler finds out his stats are similar to Charles Barkley and they both have won 0 championships while Michael Jordan has won 6 Championships.

Jimmy Butler: No! ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ No!!!!! 

Charles Barkley: Retire from the NBA and join me on TNT. Together we can overthrow Stephen A Smith and ESPN. Then we will have the most popular sports show in history. 

Jimmy falls off platform and Bam Calrissian saves him."
Lol nuggets are full of comedians.
"I swear, Joker's a little more relaxed, carefree,  and loose-lipped here compared to past interviews.  Would this be the effect of the bubbly free-flowing after the game? If so, no harm done!  :D"
What's Britney Griner doing up there?
Jimmyâ€™s a great guy and all but Miamiâ€™s gotta look elsewhere because although he clearly has what it takes to get there twice; he just doesnâ€™t have what it takes to get it done. He fizzled out and the fire went out. Heâ€™s 7 years past the average retirement age for an NBA player and this was his shot and he blew it.
They will be back! 2024
"Denver Nuggets, the strongest among the strongest ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª"
It's Pat Riley's fault
I never thought gordon would come this far after being in Orlando Magic hell for like 8 years
i never been so happy for a young player
"Malone: I'm now a champion
Stockton: Congrats"
Knew the Kings blew it years ago letting Malone go
Heat is trashðŸ¤£
"Gamal Murray is a hero,
His performance in real time, under pressure, and in general it is the performance of a brilliant genius,
I really appreciate this man,
His mental fortitude and focus on winning for the team is perfect!"
Highlight of Aaronâ€™s career. Getting screwed over two dunk contests and this would beat any dunk contest now.
hahaha with all that booing when his name was called fans never knew how great that dude is haha
God bless Jamal Murray!
A great coach and a true gentleman.
"Yeah like I said back then, this was a crappy interview, nothing but lowballs for Ja, this was pretty much was a PR puff piece rather than real journalism. And without any accountability for Ja, this happened all over again."
hall of fame... no doubt
This video did not age well.
"""That's supposed to be a joke and you (the media) never laugh. Good job guys.""

*Roasted*"
â¤ðŸŽ‰he's got it all he is amazing basketball player's
It's so beautiful to see how dear coach Malone and Nikola have their values aligned so beautifully. May God guard your souls.
Both of these guys had critical fxxk ups. Butler with the turnover and the Lowry with the idiotic foul.
"Love his attitude. just like yeah we did it, good job, now Im gonna go home...thanks.."
Congrats malon you played your cards the right way ....
Denver won this game off pure grit. They made tough contested shots to win. Both teams deserved to win tonight. Great battle
Iâ€™m a heat fan but Bruce brown played down here at The []_[] so Iâ€™m proud of the boy !!!
"Iâ€™m not a nuggets fan and really didnâ€™t know about Michael Malone until 2020. But man this franchise and this level of brotherhood and as well as the love of the game really speaks volumes of this coaching staff and these players. Such a deserving group and really such an amazing championship journey. The nuggets are a young team and they are just not only so poised, but also so disciplined in how the approach the game as well as how well they play it. An absolute joy to see the game played this way and congratulations to the nugget nation. You not only have yourself one hell of a team but also one hell of a coach"
The most deserving guy win it. It's so rare. Unbelievable!!!
"This is the first time Ive watched a post game presser and its all because of Jokic. The guy has that kinda effect on people. Hes making the NBA watchable again even post game interviews. What a dude, what a team. Congrats to the Nuggets yall deserve it!"
He has potential to be Canada's greatest player ever
They can't be disappointed in losing. But they can be disappointed in being so far from winning.
Heat culture give up in nba final throw games and nba and espn hates Florida all together.  Mark my word Jimmy butler wont win championship in Miami heat . Jim good at give up nba final. Be different nba team in nba final next year.
"Nuggets fan here: Jimmy hit the nail on the head, when you look at this series it came down to which team missed more shots. The nuggets offensively outside of Jokic were terrible in game one but they managed to win. The Heat were terrorizing them on defense and that zone D absolutely had the Nuggets flat. If the Heat make a few more shots, this could have easily started 2-0 in favor of the Heat and we would be looking at a 6-7 game series with the Heat having a real possibility of winning that chip. Game three, nuggets played to win that game and I'm not sure there was anything really to point to besides the unbelievable play from Jokic and Murray for that win for the Nugs. Game 4 and Game 5, the Heat did what they always do, play unbelievable defense. I think this series outside of game 3 was an absolute dog fight, one that the Heat could have won if a few more buckets went down each game. Kudos to these two teams and we as basketball fans should feel so fortunate to have witnessed such a battle between two teams that really have some of the most straightforward and humble players on both sides. Lowry got my respect in that Raptors and GS series when he was yelling at the fans to stop applauding KD's injury and to see him battle is always a treat. BAM... who can that guy not guard? He absolutely shut down Jamal anytime he was on him and had arguably the toughest assignment the postseason in having to guard Jokic. I'd love to see him be Nugget haha. And Jimmy, nuff said. He and Bam carried a team and he unfortunately had 1 turnover... 1! that ended their fight. Unbelievable playoff run"
Ya'll prepared for Ja Wick 2?
My Heat just ran out of gas it just happens
If denver have mpj healthy no tean Can beat team
Stepped up big time tonight! Nuggs really needed it.
Jimmy is not 100% since Game 1 of Knicks series.
SMILE = CHARITY
Ja requires wisdom. I suggest all of us faith based men pledge that he study the book of proverbs written by King Solomon and yield to councel.
"God bless Coach Michael Malone, congrats on being a NBA Champion!"
The Team really love each other they deserve it
Big man ! Serbia love coach Malone
This didnâ€™t age well
cavs and gsw have a Great match until durant distoys the equilibrium
Heat culture will win game 5 on the road. Heat isn't finish!. They'll shock the world by winning the NBA Title this year. Watch it unfolds.
What a Coach â¤ congrats
From Back Problems to a Chip ðŸŽ‰ Well Deserved
"Jokic: championship its ok.. not the most important.. 
Reporter: Porter wasnt making shots but got a double doubleâ€¦
Jokic: now this is very good we will celebrate tonight about thisâ€¦"
curry and durant together might hav ewon 3 more chips
Hands down the best player in the league righty now and it's not that close.
Ja Morant lies well. His character is way off. No judgement just facts. SMH
"Feel so satisfied to see AG win it all against Miami, and to explode at their home stadium."
GJ Coach Malone  !
Imagine if Jokic got all 3 MVPs. Still one of  the most dominant seasons in history. Big man deserves all the love
surprised he didnâ€™t guarantee the first ever 4-1 comeback
16-4 playoff run. Well done.
Heâ€™s Top 3 all timeðŸ’¯
Jokic being an asshole is primetime tv
Man I really wanted jimmy to win it all. Instead he got done like every black sports movie and lost in end ðŸ˜­
Jokic is an amazing player yet very professional and humble. Very refreshing in this day and age of self absorbed and self promoting athletes.  Keep it up Joker!
"REGGAE,REGGAE,REGGAE,REGGAE,REGGAE"
Heat was 2-7 in their last 9 games
Honestly Jokic isn't that good he just benefits from the league no longer using a big man. He just backs down smaller defenders and tosses it in from a foot away
I'm glad that Mike back on game 5 ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
Puff piece. Youâ€™re better than this Jalen. Softballs.
Ask Emid now if he deserves the MVP TROPHY.If he is honest as the Joker he will say the Joker should have been the one to win The NBA BASKETBALL  ðŸ€  MVP for 2023.The sports writers eat crow.
The shooter of all times Larry Bird.
WHATEVER IT TAKES!
jokic vs hakeem would be great both dominant and high iq players
Why donâ€™t they just fire him and find someone else that appreciates and respects their life and career.
"Ooh YESSSS LETTTT USSS  GOOOOO DENVER'SSSS GOD BLESSSS YOU KEEP UP THE AGRESSSION AND THE ATTITUDE STAY FOCUS THEY ARE COMING HARD ,,,, I SMELL VICTORRRY .. NUGGETS ALL THE WAYYYYY ..ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘"
"Aaron has never smoked a cigar in his life. Toss that thing away, Champ!!!"
Jimmy threw that game hard
This kid is unbelievably stupid
"He back at it brothas. Season 2 coming out already!!!

Now, tbh we are all stupid, and there are loads of people who would do the same if they were given the opportunity."
Steph curry > lebron
These are both classy gentlemen showing good sportsmanship by being gracious in defeat.
"Air Gordon was a champion out there ðŸ’ªðŸ’¯ðŸ€
Brown was clutch! They came through man 
These 2 are fantastic together"
"What does this culture expect when they listen to music that boast in the fact that they shoot people, steal each otherâ€™s girlfriends and wifeâ€™s, boast in the fact that they do drugs. The culture is just going to adapt that lifestyle."
Heat esp Butler got a little cocky in this series. They thought winning will just be on their side again.
Who do you want me to make a documentary about next!?
Great guy.  Totally opposite lechoke

Itâ€™s not just the starting 5, itâ€™s the team, itâ€™s not just my daughter, itâ€™s my whole family, I didnâ€™t slam the chair, I yelled at them, theyâ€™re used to it.  His mind is healthy, he just puts his head down and he appreciates the process and experience."
Steph curry is one of the player who idolize most of three pointer from today's player.
Jimmy to the blazers
Mike Malone is an incredible coach! His knowledge of the game is vast and he is a true competitor
This is a humble dude ...cheers to the nuggets
Adenâ€™s yo is the real star of the Miami Heat!
These NBA thouroughbreds go to these BETA clinics with BETA people trying to show ALPHAS how to behave like BETas. Its loonacy. You need alphas to show alphas.

LeGoat still the last player to win a championship for this franchise
MarQueef on suicide watch ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
"The typos on the hat...SMH. What is a ""champian""?"
"Aaron Gordon is genuinely the 3rd best player on this team. 

I guess a ring is much better than a slam dunk contest victory."
Howâ€™s Jokic ankle ?
"did i miss something? its not the first serbian to win a ring. Stojakovic won it with the mavs, Bjelica with warriors and probably some more."
4:00 â€œAmericans are suppose to be the best because of all the gold metals they have.â€ Huh???

"Now no one can't say he's not one of the best PG in the league. If you add Ja the GTA's real immitator without adding this man. Man you need to think again.

Mike â€œnever swing the rockâ€ porter congrats ðŸŽ‰
Jalen Rose should never do another interview. He was showing remorse talking to a guy who does not care. This video didnâ€™t age well.
For me stephen curry is not only the greatest shooter ever but also he is the Greatest of all time player.thank you for making us happy everytime you play.GOD BLESS
How many other players would sit in front of a mic and tell the world 'I'm glad coach took me out and put in another player' when it mattered the most?  Love this team!
Jimmy is an absolute legend. The only one left with the mamba mentality. No excuses. Real leader. Holds himself accountable 100% of the time. Absolutely love this guy.

Where is the whatsapp lineee can anyone tell mee
"China's per capita GDP is higher than many European countries.

"One example about Chinese manufacturing being more than just cheap labor is Cigarette lighters: How cheap can you make a lighter?
It doesn't have to be anything fancy, just a boring generic plastic product that is (1) able to light things up, and (2) as cheap as possible.
The BIC(French) lighters costs 16 US cents back in 1987, now they are around 20 cents apiece to manufacture.
On the other hand, modern Chinese manufacturers are making them at a cost just under 2 US cents apiece, and if you are willing to pay for shipping you can get them at ~3 cents apiece in bulk today.
At that price level you can't afford any low-level workers, and instead everything has to be automated.
You can't cut corners too far either because even a 1% defect rate is going to cost more than the savings from the cut corners.
It takes an incredible amount of expertise in product engineering, logistics, automation, and quality control to make such a mundane product as a lighter."

I would like to do Data science course
"This is in direct contrast to those who peddle gloom and doom narrative about the Chinese economy. Clearly the authorities have made serious mistakes during the zero-covid lockdown. However,  we can clearly observe China is playing the long game, procuring important raw materials and mining rights all over the globe and installing robots to move into high value manufacturing. In other words China will be new Japan but 10 times stronger. They will keep high tec manufacturing within China and export cheaper product factories to low wage countries in the Global South - factory wages in China are rising over $500 per month so Chinese factories in Ethiopia are paying $50 per month (yes, shameful) and these products are exported to the West.
So, China is increasing their manufacturing base in the Global South and will continue to export to the West from these (clear examples are Mexico, Brazil, Ethiopia, Egypt etc.) as well as high tec from the mainland China. This is their long game."

"Excellent video!  Rumi said when you start on a journey, on the way, the way will appear.  Well, I wanted to have some purpose in my retirement and was thinking of starting an online course on mindfulness.  This week I started jotting down my thoughts on course development but hadn't yet done any online research.  On my way home from shopping I stumbled across your video while looking for something to listen to on the way home.  Your video was just the kickstart I needed.  I'm now so inspired and see a way forward!!!  I came home and played it again and took notes!  Thank you so much."

IÂ´m getting started as a coach & this is GOLD!! The creating an evergreen business & stepping away from a launch model is deeply attractive. I kind of assumed the launch model was the only way. Learned something massive today.
"The robot that replace 10 workers, did the calculation factor in workers work for 8 hours/day, that means the robot has a magnitude of time 3, also the robot can increase the speed of operation once it have muster her line of work. If you didn't factor this, its fair to state one robot has a hypothetical potential to replace over 30 workers per robot. That one robot, how many times will it broken down in a year. Have in mind the robot can sense its motors performance, replacing that will be so cheap to a level we cant state that theirs someone hired to be replacing motors or motherboards.  From that angle how many people will it hire to maintain it, the other layman's reasoning is, we will be building this robots. How on earth will that happen, the robots will build themselves. Just a few will design, therefore the ratio of workers replaces cant keep up with jobs created by this robots."

Education is top priority of almont every chinese family. China has 8-10million uni graduates every year which is 1/3 of the world. That is reason China is and will be top manufacturer even next 50-100 years.
"The Chinese are very intelligent. They work hard and at a reasonable cost. They have the best customer service . India would have to learn from them. India is a long way behind China in development and customer service, but acts like China.
Within 20 years, China will be stronger than any other country combined."

"I would say the most important would be, people are looking for freedom. Freedom to make as much money as they want, freedom to choose how much they want to work and freedom to live the way you want. People should know most of all why do they want to start a coaching program? This is essential. You have to know why first. The how will reveal itself when you know the why first. Actually, results are the first thing you observe. The results tell you what you were thinking. If the results are not what you wanted, you can change how you think and your approach."
"You will see COVID in every few years.  As long as they want to reduce the number of old slaves, there will be more contagious diseases in China.  If they don't get rid of their old slaves now, the COVID will drag on for a few more years."

Do you think it's a good idea to have a mini course on a subject pulled from your big program/course to sell as well for people who'd want to check it all out before investing a lot of money first?
"Many large major factories in China are already highly automated.

To give you an example, the best selling electric vehicle (EV) in the luxury category in China is a Chinese EV called HiPhi X :
https://youtu.be/MLffQ9ESSTI

As the company was new, the first buyers last year were treated as VIPs.  And one of them (a real estate youtuber) eventually had the privilege of given a private tour of the car factory.

The guy was absolutely dumbfounded.  The factory had very few human workers.  The whole factory was mostly automated (at least the parts he was shown).

I would imagine many other EV factories are probably quite similar"
robots are taking over chinese factories because wsj sent all human factory workers to enlist in military to make more news on taiwan

okay. so then if everything is automated moving the factories and production back to the U.S. shouldn't be a big deal. we no longer need to manufacture anything in china.
itâ€™s all that made in china bs since some of their workers are scammers and cheapskates

(Paraphrasing) Jesus will return to earth to punish those that rebelled against him with the word of god. After the 4th horseman of the apocalypse. 95 Ce. Vishnu will return to punish those that perpetrated evil against him after the 4th stage of the earth cycle. 6th century BCE. I wonder where the authors of the buybull got the idea from for the return of Jesus in the New Testament. Hmmmmmm.
Love it brother ðŸ™Œ#anthem
To be honest I found fabvl because of his song Mad House and I just thought â€œholy shit! This man is amazing!â€ Then I started listening to music made by him.
Matt Ramsey is a monster!

Your a Legend. Love your rock
Your voice is unreal"
Fabvl .let me just tell you something.....my name is tom and im 30 years old and have 2 little girl and a wife . im from isreal . I love your music over 2 years now! You are my hope for all man out there ..your music is amazing !!!!
"Iâ€™m just going to say it. Fabvl actually saved my life. I was in a realy realy realy rough time of my life, school was not working, bullies bullied me day and day, my best friend got to a higher school, and the worst of allâ€¦ my ex left me and I realized she used me for stuff like school, home stuff etc. The most painful thing of itâ€¦ she faked the love to me for the last 5 months we where together. I was 13/14 at that moment and i was depressed. I couldnâ€™t trust anyone, was mad and sad all the time, but for some reason also dead from inside. Than i met the music of fabvlâ€¦ and that made me realize there is still hope. And with listening to fabvlâ€™s songs and being strong, iâ€™m now the person i am now. So i want to thank Fabvl for helping me and maybe actually saving a life. Thank youðŸ’šðŸ’šðŸ’š"

"Thank you Lord,  for allowing me to view this message! It has been very plainly explained in helping understand God's view on a lot of today's issues, and for me, the abortion issue! Help us Lord!! SIN IS SIN!!! And as it has been  so simply stated, God has given us a mind of ""choice"", BUT, if we are deeply, rooted, followers of the Lord commandments,  and part of the remnant church, we have the word to let us know what is right, and what is wrong!!!  THOU SHALT NOT KILL!!! Keep studying faithfully, daily, because we have to be able to have the spirit with in us to guide us in these last days, and to be able to explain God's word to others!

When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Living alone
I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself

All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself
Anymore

"This song is so hot on fire I was dating an amazingly sexy guy in the military both of us were in the military, and this song came out with her version of it and I would just think about him and it was crazy and the words fit us. It was just so beautiful and it's such a great memory we'd fly back and forth just to see each other. Thank you Celine!!!ðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜‚â¤"

Who is that entitled kid playing the guitar?  He barely got hair down there compared to the FAMOUS singers.  Does he really think he is all of that?
Right.     Breathe.
One of my all time favorite songs and video. Still listening in 2023. The dancer was a nice addition.â¤ï¸ðŸ”¥â¤ï¸ðŸ”¥â¤ï¸ðŸ”¥

"I can listen to this woman all day ,everyday.."
Wearing the inside out
She has a manly vibe about her.
"Eric absolutely NAILS the solos in this song [he did the original ones, after all...].  Personally, I can't stand Prince's performance of this song.  The title of the song is about the guitar ""gently weeping,"" which is precisely what Eric makes it do.  Prince's playing just doesn't fit.  Lots pf people like his playing, but he overdoes it.  I've jammed along to this progression plenty of times, and it indeed offers great opportunities for solos and it's fun, but Eric just nails it.  Superb job, Mr. Clapton, and RIP George.  Beautiful to see the loving tribute."

It really doesn't get any better....what a catalog of legendary material!
I can humbly realate
"My ex hated Camila & I always loved camila & always will,even when my ex wasnâ€™t my ex I loved camila more than I loved her & I never appreciated the insults she made to camila,Iâ€™m glad that I donâ€™t have to talk nor see my ex ever again but I will always have videos of camila which make me happier than my ex ever did,I love camila cabello & always will,camila is my true #1 & the true goddess of beauty & talent,these are facts."

"I designed the Airbus A380 GP7000 fan blade; the big blades that you see from outside the engine.  They are huge titanium pieces of metal, which if liberated can slice the airplane fuselage in half. Yup the whole plane with people."
Love this song makes you think what you are and how worthy you are. Someone is there to make you threw the bad times.
Jeff Lynne in the mix also.
"First I heard this, I was hoping she could hang with Cyndi. She did fine job."
LOVE KEITH ! what a singer. what a great guitarist !
"Whatâ€™s funny about the CFG is that Eric is playing rhythm guitar, while Oingo Boingoâ€™s Marc Mann (Blue Cap) is on lead while in the shadows, same as on the George HOF induction where Prince rips it up."
This is exactly how a guitar is supposed to weep! Clapton knows best because Clapton is God!!
"Big Big Fan, John is the best, and you can tell he is Proud of his Kid's.."
I wanted to let you know that Iâ€™ve been listening to you for years.

I play your song constantly on my love and best wishes Liz the queen.

I Love this Music Video! and the scene at 1:20 where it shows that hes a corrupted Form from sans that has escaped the Genocide route. aka Geno!Sans. by the way in almost all of the ERROR Sans types and Especilly those that arent so nice. ive seen its a link between Geno!Sans and them if you skip all the midle characters if theres any. so this Music Video has its own plot that ERROR!Sans is a corrupted form of Geno!Sans. witch makes sense by ERROR!Sans's insanity and the Anti:Void that Geno!Sans and ERROR!Sans end up in. (Sorry for writing a long comment i got a writing problem... and prob a nerd for that matter)

when i downloaded the software i noticed i could control more of the parameters with the knobs etc but the funciontality of changing presets with the main knob no longer works 

its probably me but curious what people did for this - if i cant use this main knob to change the presets of the the mini v - im gonna be a lil disappointed - i get i have to map 3rd party plugins - but it should be automatic with arturia things 

maybe im just acting entitled? - enlighten me"

"Everytime I record something with automation - say using Analog Lab 4 plugin and mess around with the knobs while recording - automation ALWAYS needs to be re-enabled when I stop recording, click on a certain part of the track, click play/pause, pretty much all the time making it impossible to record/play with automation. This behaviour however doesn't happen if I use my mouse instead of the minilab. Any ideas?"

"ðŸ§˜â€â™‚ï¸THE TECHNIQUEðŸ‘ï¸
The goal of this technique is to activate your Pineal and Pituitary Glands/ Third Eye. You must realize that the metaphysical experience is the direct result of a physical process that you force to occur within your body. Begin by laying down in a safe place. Do a basic meditation to relax your body and clear your mind. Once you are relaxed, you are going to start squeezing and expanding your brain. Your brain is attached to muscles and tendons that let you expand and squeeze it. Bring your focus to your forehead and try squeezing and expanding your frontal lobe. Concentrate and keep trying until you can get it. Once you can feel it moving then move to the center of your brain, (this is where the glands are located, the Eye of RA) and do the same thing. Squeeze then stretch it out, feel it expand as if past your skull, squeeze, expand... After a few minutes move to the back lower area of your brain where the Claustrum is located. This is where the Sacred Oil is produced by mixing the fluids from the two glands. Do the same, squeeze, expand over and over. Once you get the hang of it, start doing it in a wave motion from the frontal lobe to the bottom of the claustrum. Continue squeezing and expanding repeatedly until you can start to feel the fluids moving, such as mucus running down the back of your throat. Some people, myself included, experience something that sounds and feels like a crust breaking off the outside of your brain, this is normal. The objective is to get your brain working, you have never used it like this before. Once you get the fluids moving you want to push the Oil from the Claustrum down the back of the spine, down your nervous system and back up the front. Using your back muscles, push the fluid down the back of your spine to the bottom. Then squeeze your muscles in your lower area like your buttocks and sphincter to start pushing the fluid up the front of your spine. Men as well as women have kegel muscles, use these like a pump. Suck in your stomach and your chest muscles, push the back of your tongue up to help push the fluid up the front of your spine into your brain, pumping the fluid up the front of the nervous system into the Thalamus, the seat of God. Continue repeating this pattern, from the front of your brain to the back of your brain, down the back of your spine to the bottom, and up the front of your spine into your brain. Repeat this process as long as you can. When I did this I was not staring at a clock but it felt like an hour. Realistically I would say 15 to 30 minutes. I did it until all of a sudden I couldn't close my eyes! Not even to blink. This lasted for several minutes. At first I thought I broke my brain! As soon as I was able to relax enough to barely close my eyes, I slipped...  
Some things to note: 
1. I know to a lot of people this sounds weird, (like it's not already weird) but you need to make sure that the Moon is in your Sun Star sign. The Moon affects the fluids in your body and helps the Oil be created. 
2. The ancient gnostic text talk about sexual abstinence in order to get this to work. I refrained from having sex for two weeks before I did this.
3. Make sure you are in a good place in your head and that you have pure thoughts. Because if you don't, you won't go all the way to the end and meet the Light. 
4. If this does not work the first time, try decalcifying your brain for six months and then come back and try again. I put in a reverse osmosis machine under my kitchen sink for $150.00 and I quit using fluoride toothpaste. Fluoride calcifies the pineal gland, which is what we are trying to activate. 
5. This last one is a WARNING. Working on yourself is PARAMOUNT beforehand so that you have the best positive experience you can. Also, you need those skills for afterwards. I was super high for about 2 weeks and then I became insanely negative. It took a lot of hard work to crawl out of that hole and then maintain the connection, so you need to be prepared for that mentally. SUICIDE HAS OCCURRED IN THE UNPREPARED. THIS IS LIFE CHANGING. Make sure you have some good meditation techniques. Maybe have a friend handy to lean on a little.
In my experience I was granted one wish, I wanted to be emotionally healed from the damage caused by being an innocent man on death row. I was also gifted with a vision. The Chrystal Light Being touched my heart in order to heal it so that I could love my family properly, and it showed me that everyone on Earth has this Light Being inside of them. Everyone will have their own experience. This is how to have a true Kundalini Awakening, but it's also called the Anointing of the Christ/Chrism Oil, the return of Christ is the return of this knowledge to you. This is what it means to have Christ in you inorder to enter Heaven, it's something you do while you are alive. Email me at jcchrism at yahoo. com for a free pdf with more info. Good luck my friend. 
I love youâ¤ï¸

That background music is sooooo distracting and unnecessary.  I keep having to stop and go back so I can understand what this man is saying. .  Does Arturia produce any real step by step tutorials? This sounds more like a commercial!
"so no instructions unless we download all the software, which is useless for me. I'm not changing DAWs for a MIDI controller."
This has to be the WORST tutorial in the history of mankind.

"I am really struck at the behavior of scientists, the immaturity and naivete on display, the tight confines of behavior that has the look of a religion or cult or some other forced and stilted thing. Not surprising as there's a smooth gradient from the general culture where religious or no fundament prevails to this part which nervously proclaims a new thing which is equally lacking in fundament, moving from empirical certainties to ever more tenuous assertions of religion-like beliefs, speculation grading into assertion. The breathless Nova is an excellent showcase of this."

"my ""personal trend"" for summer rn is super specific bc it stems from my current adhd hyperfixation which is sailing alksdjdskds I've been binge watching this sailing family vlog channel, they're so genuine and cool and idk the mom is so beautiful and maybe it's just that the clothes look good on her but I find myself really wanting to dress like her this summer but ik I'll be too insecure. she usually wears like, tied up t shirts (to make them cropped) or bikini tops with a light jacket and a sarong and always sandals. idk why I hated sandals before but I actually bought sandals on thredup purely for my ""sailorcore"" ideas loool. I'm sad I don't have a good swimsuit that actually fits me, I have a bikini top from a couple years ago but idk I don't really like the style or color of it anymore, so when summer gets closer I might just buy a bikini for when my partner and I go swimming bc his grandparents have a pool in their backyard :) I'm also gonna put little applique daisies on the sandals bc I saw sandals like that in a fashion mobile game I play and I think that'd make the sandals more wearable for me?? I just need my shoes to be cute af lmao idk. I have no idea if I'll be comfortable wearing a bikini bottom by itself this summer bc I'm really insecure about that area of my body and I have scars on my thighs that are still healing but hopefully they heal in time for summer. just in case I'll buy some swim shorts that are cute enough but I REALLY wanna be able to just wear a sarong over my bikini but right now it would show my scars :/ but yeah I guess ""modern sailorcore"" is what I'm dubbing it, is very similar to mermaidcore. I like some aspects of mermaidcore but I feel like a whole mermaidcore outfit is kinda too much for me personally but I'm definitely looking up some inspo on pinterest later for my modern sailorcore aesthetic lmao.

idk if it's a personal trend like a temporary thing or just my style changing but I think last year I was really into short skirts and now I'm getting a lot more into midi/maxi skirts, as long as they're light and flowy enough bc it gets hoooottt here in summer, but it's not only cute, it's really great functionally bc it protects me from the sun (a ginger living in nevada is a bad combo lmao) and I don't have to worry about showing my thighs too much or the wind blowing up my skirt, but then wearing shorts underneath a skirt for extra protection just means more layers and makes me sweat more </3 so I'm def gonna be looking for longer skirts at the thrift store!"

"I always look for small original art (it amazes me what people donate), glassware and servingware. I'm a minimalist, so it's one in one out, so I'm selective, but I enjoy browsing. That measuring cup is a score because the measurements are embossed so they won't wear off!"
Why do you scream? This video sounds so loud.
I like the fusia  with basic and monochrome pieces and bring out a splash of colour and still remain classic.  I also really like focusing on waist and basic boots.  Always trendy and classic!  Great job Justine; loves your video. â¤â¤â¤

"it's so so off when ppl just rely on fashion trends or ""micro core"" aesthetics. sick. just buy clothes that  you're sure gonna wear in a long term period of time, choose something that you like something that fits you well and the item that is easily combined with other items in your closet. if you're don't know why you buying it and FOR WHAT reason then focus on basic clothes or don't buy AT ALL. no need to be dumb and consume whatever you see"
Please tell us what you are wearing with haul. Thank you

"I havenâ€™t been as loyal to your channel lately because most of your recommendations are wayyyyy out of my budget.  Veronica Beard is great, but spending  $500 on one piece of clothing is not feasible for most people. I appreciate your showing the trend in the expensive venue, but I would appreciate it more if you then showed TRUE  budget friendly options.  Your â€œSimilar for Lessâ€ options are still quite pricey. Just my take."

"Hi Orly, I'm 62 and around 5 months ago I bought a pair of thigh high black faux leather boots with built in stir ups & belt.  There low heal and I absolutely love them.  But the faux leather have been peeling alot.  Other people tell me that they don't notice it, but I do and I hate that.  I got them on Amazon for under $50.00 I learned you get what you pay for.  Could you please come up with a way that I can make them Beautiful so I can keep wearing them.  I know it sounds a bit crazy that a 62 year old woman wears these kind of boots.  I believe my mother gave birth to me to stand out and not fit in.  I am the type to dance to my own beat and don't care who's watching."

"I'm jelly on the shoes. I was told a several years ago by foot doctor that I could wear only New Balance, and Birkenstocks.  I've given away most of my shoes and it's not been easy.

Hey man can you suggest suitable clothing For Bike Riders?
Those night stands turned out beautifully and I believe that style is referred to as the campaign style. Those pieces can be very pricey if truly vintage and in good shape. I need to order some of that paint for a few projects of my own. ðŸ˜Š

You found a lot of nice items.  I never find really nice items at thrift stores.  Our thrift stores just arenâ€™t very good.  I love the large basket with the lid.  Iâ€™m new to your channel and I really enjoyed this video . Thanks for sharing your haul.
This was very interesting and informative!  I had no idea that so much donated clothing ends up in the landfills.
"You didnâ€™t mention anything about boots. Other than that, great video."
I love these ideas. Buuuut I have kids & a dog ðŸ˜¢
"The boxer boots made me think of some of Grace Jones's album covers and photos from the 1980s.  She was photographed in boxer boots quite a bit.  Also, the cone heels were big in the 80's and I've seen those recently in the output of high-end designers like Isabel Marant.  If you lived through it the first time, it grabs your attention when you see it again!"
"I finally have a nice collection of linen dresses and skirts, which are all I wear in high summer.  I really wanted to have enough so I donâ€™t have to wash and iron them all the time.  I do re-iron them after every wearing, but itâ€™s not as big a chore as ironing freshly-washed ones.  I just donâ€™t have a cool place to iron so I try to get it done first thing in the morning in the summer.  My tip:  wash linen in the delicate cycle and it wonâ€™t get as mangled and wrinkled.  Nothing else is as comfortable as linen in real heat and humidity, so I think itâ€™s worth the extra trouble of ironing, I just try to minimize it.  Keeping styles tailored and simple also helps, no puffed sleeves, gathers, tiers, etc."
"I don't think I have liked a collection from anyone since 2013. They're so impractical and frankly, unflattering this year. In the stores the supply chain issues are still evident ðŸ¤·"
So beautiful as usual

I love the cheaper marble pieces like mortar/pestles from the TJX stores and the bathroom trays - same quality at a fraction of the cost and just use the bowls for many things.

"I signed up for AOD 6 months ago. I am a Producer and Story Work Editor for NatGeo and a Writer for PBS Kids. Even though Iâ€™ve been in the game for years with winning awards along the way, I still learned from this class. There were also some techniques that I havenâ€™t done in years and the class reminded me of them. If anything, listening and watching these classes, kept me in the film mode and had me constantly thinking about how I am going to go about making my upcoming documentary. Worth every penny."

"Is it true that the KKK was started by Democrats? ChatGPT: ""Yes, it is true that the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was initially formed by Democrats in the southern United States after the Civil War. However, it is important to note that the Democratic Party of that time was very different from the modern Democratic Party in terms of its ideology and platform. The KKK was formed in the aftermath of the Civil War as a white supremacist organization that sought to maintain the racial hierarchy of the South and intimidate and oppress African Americans.

It is also important to note that over time, the KKK has been embraced by members of both political parties, and its membership has included both Democrats and Republicans. However, it is inaccurate to suggest that the KKK is solely or primarily a Democratic organization, as its membership has included individuals from a range of political affiliations over the years."""
"Thanks for recommending this. Iâ€™ve downloaded it and trialled it but found it a bit tricky. Would you recommend listening to the video to check the transcript is correct first? I wish I had as it meant that I deleted out what I thought was a odd word but it was just incorrectly transcribed. 

Once deleted out, I assume you canâ€™t get that segment back?"
"And in court, they tell us to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth....

"The presentation was a little too dramatic thanks to Coulthard which was unnecessary in my opinion. The content was sufficient on its own to make a good case for the existence of bona fide UFO sightings and the existence of non-human species visiting our planet.  I had an unusual sighting late on a summer's afternoon. I was sitting in a cottage looking across an expanse of 8 miles of water to the far shore. The cottage was in deep shade with the sun setting behind tall trees to my left. We had no lights on in the cottage making the interior of the cottage quite dark. Suddenly the interior of the cottage lit up with a warm, pinkish orange light. I had had my head down when my girlfriend who was sitting directly across from me on another couch asked me what was causing the cottage to light up inside. I looked up and directly across from the cottage above the far shore was an orange object with a diameter that would have equaled three city buses linked end to end. The object was round with spikes of light radiating in 360 degrees from the center of the object as though the object was spiking with light on all parts of its circumference.  I picked up a pair of kids binoculars, probably 10x power to get a closer look. By this time the light had been pulsing for about 10 seconds. Through the binoculars I got to watch it for about another three seconds when the strangest thing happened. Imagine you are looking at a circle that is divided in a line in the middle from top to bottom when suddenly the right side half circle begins to close toward the center line like the back half of a book closing toward the front half of the book. After the right side half circle reach the vertical mid-line all of the background that had been covered by the light when it was a full circle was revealed, such that I could see all the land, the trees and the blue sky. But the circular object continued to close from right to left and the minute the half circle of light of the right side had covered the left side half circle the glowing orb disappeared and all of the background features of the land, the forest and the sky was visible and glowing light within the cottage disappeared completely. Weird. Not a natural phenomena of this earth."

"What I can't understand is that. What would make them hate people of color for no good reason. When these people were in their own continent minding their own business and living their own lives. Not thinking about those people who invaded their land enslaved, raped and murdered them and shipped them to foreign countries. People who had done absolutely nothing to them. I mean truly you would have to be purely evil and wicked to do such thing. Too simply hate a whole race of people committing all manner of wicked atrocities too. And still goes to church in Sundays are purely of the Devil ðŸ˜ˆ. And all I have to say is this, May they all rest in a place where the Sun will never shine and forever walk on burning brimstones."

"The irony is that as the demand in Western countries goes up, and the methods for cultivation themselves are Westernized then the very vitamins, minerals and macronutrients that made them a ""superfood"" most likely goes down. I'm no botanist or nutrition expert but I bet if we had heritage varieties of the grains we are used to, cultivated in the old ways then many of them may be ""superfoods"". My point being is that it isn't just a different species of grain (quinoa is technically a pseudocereal btw) , but an entirely different culture behind its production."

We can agree to watch out for soy that is not organic or minimally processed or eaten very rarely. From my endo to you! Be aware of what you share. Soy isn't like it is in the USA especially.

"here we are up in the North where it was 43 degrees last night, going to be 41 tonight, haven't dared to plant my peppers yet, it's typically Memorial Day weekend when people set out peppers, tomatoes, curcurbits.  Depending on the snowfall we typically can't get onions or potatoes into the raised garden beds until early May, once in awhile there's less snow & mid-April is possible.  Just mentioning this since some areas will not be able to interplant due to the onions still being REALLY small when you finally get the peppers out there (which are big due to growing indoors for 3 months).  In a shorter growing area, onions do best planted by themselves and yes fertilize as mentioned.  But the short season requires maximum sunlight which is not possible when shaded by peppers."

"Hello, ur video has touched my heart."
"This video has several million views with practical uses in treating mental health disorders. Implementing diet and showing that 100% of people who change their diets have incredibly decreased if not eliminated their symptoms.

I watched the video with Karl Deisseroth and noticed a huge difference in their approach. Karl is very pro medications and feels theyâ€™re effective despite the increase in mortality and often unbearable symptoms. I canâ€™t help but feel dissuaded from the field of mental health due to the constant rigorous implication we need to be medicated. 

Just an observation, but I much more appreciate palmerâ€™s approach and it doesnâ€™t appear as disabling. I wish more physicians were open minded like him."

When I was nineteen I started to feel a magnetic sensation in my third area or rather between the eyebrows. Putting a pen or even my finger pointing at it made it stronger. When I took a strong and sudden breath into my nostrils then there was a sudden light appearing internally. As the Bible says. Let thine eye be single and see the light. Even now when I am writing this then the third eye activates my root chakra and these two connect together by raising the energy from the root chakra with slight help from the PC muscle. Science will always be ignorant until it admits or proves that we are more than this body of ours.

"Most people have mental health problems.

Because we live unnaturally. 

Or better say: We DONT live.

We are forced to exist in a box when we were made to be free.

We sense the insanity of other people so we avoid them just so their insanity would not harm us.

Since people are everywhere,it is really hard to avoid them.

On top of it all the government,corporations,religions all want a piece of us on a daily basis.

They all demand that we give them money from our boxes or else they will make our lives very miserable. 

(more miserable then we already are)"

"I've been desperate for mental health help since I was about 6 years old. I'm 31 now and still have never seen a mental health professional. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder by a GP about ten years ago but after trying a couple of failed meds I just never got more help. I live in a pretty decent sized city yet there's only one mental health facility and it has low ratings. On top of that, it's very expensive to pay for that help. It's just not accessible. I've felt suicidal so many times in my life and it's an inexplicably devastating place to be."

"So happy for this new meditation, thanks from my heart!"
"Not a truly diabetic diet. If you are a diabetic in reality your diet should consist of meats, seafoods, fats(eggs, butter, cheese, nuts, seeds, animal fats), low carb vegetables. What you should not eat is fruit(way too high in sugar and fructose), grains(including whole grains), potatoes, corn, rice, beans. The thing is doctors are focused on keeping your blood sugar levels stable so they can prescribe a steady amount of insulin. In reality you should be focused on keeping your blood sugar as low as possible. Things like whole grains cause a slow increase in glucose but in reality over time you still have to deal with the same amount of glucose just not a sudden spike. The difference in diet may make a difference in how much and even if you require insulin. If you are being treated for diabetes always check with your doctor before making any dietary changes because insulin requirements will likely change."
"Yesâ€¦Moonlight ! I am focusing on meâ€¦ you clearly are a connected reader. You always seem to see my situation clearlyâ€¦l am not waiting for him!  I am focusing on me.. meditating, positive affirmations, journaling, and doing things in nature, that please me.

"Easy daily meditation for you and the children, It is alright to enjoy your times at home. People need to stop thinking of this as a bad thing, People can thrive by using creative energy to learn new skills, make money and help others. It is important to draw, write or create in some way while home, Being on a budget makes me be creative with cash, money for food and other expenses takes creative energy.

"Even after watching the entire video, which was enlightening, I still find that my energy, spirit, soul or whatever it is that the scientist choose to  call it,  is the final actor in the final decision(s) made.  I totally understand all the mitigating factors involved in this study but it, still, does not prove nor disprove that our energy, our self, is not the final actor in the choices made.  Question:  Does God exist?  That unknown also applies to the energy that is stored in our brain; it is:  Do you exist or does your brain exist?  The brain is an organ and it is finite.  Energy is received during the birth cycle (fetal development) and will release upon death.  What is that energy?  These are the questions I would love to see scientists tackle.  It won't happen."
"Today is my first day ðŸŽ‰ i did it i was 81 kg after a deficit calories diet i am 79.4 now i just did this my goal is to be 66kg i hope i can be able to reach my goals with this workout.

Itâ€™s because girls have the expectations of babies their whole lives. Society is just one big soft parent for women. Everything wrong in their lives can be blamed on some oppressive factor out of their control and itâ€™s their birth right to live in a world that revolves around them. They never get to develop the mental fortitude needed to deal with lifeâ€™s challenges because of all the coddling.

"There exists a multitude of meditation practices derived from diverse schools, such as the Vigyana Bhairav Tantra, which extensively documents 112 meditation techniques. The sheer abundance of options can be overwhelming when deciding which practice to select and engage in. However, Andrew Huberman's elucidation of the science behind meditation provides valuable guidance in determining the appropriate technique to practice and the ideal timing to attain the desired state, thereby enabling the cultivation of enduring traits."

"Why didn't you put the four of clubs on the other spot? 
1) There you had the 5 of diamond at an echelon line
2) The 6 of spades downwards in a vertical line from the 5 of diamond
3) The 7 of diamond on the horizontal line of the diamond 5 and then you would have it connected to the diamond 10 above in a vertical line and even have the 7 of diamond connected to your 6 of spade in an echelon line.. 

Your cards would now be more connected and have more possible directions of how the following cards (drawn) could be played. No tips or tricks in your video IMO, not even good strategy. I also disagree with organizing your cards by suit. Sometimes several suits are connected in a sequence and you should always think several plays ahead to see if you have cards or what cards you need to finish a sequence in all directions of the card laid down. So, you should organize them by how they are best played (what card connects to another, in which order you are going to play them etc.). So if a card connects to several of your cards, organize it in a way that it connects with either as many as possible of your cards or how it connects best (for instance if the cards connect tightly on the board, since this usually allows for several directions of sequences faster).

The card you start to play should always be a card that is connected to most of your other cards dealt at the start and that gives you the most/best possibilities of getting a/several sequence(s)."

Anyway in this video I have a doubt: when you create the shapes, the right one leaves a white space on the lower right angle of the slide, but when you fill that shape with image that white sapce is no more present.

"The markers on jars reminds me of what I did as a kid. On a sheet of paper, I would use a black marker and make scribbles on it, making sure there were loops and intersecting lines.

"Lately, I have really needed to hear this. I have been in the position my whole life of having known this sentence, but over the years, believing it was for someone who needed it more than me. Soon after somewhere down that road, it turned to the belief that it did not apply to me, not that I don't matter as a person, but that my struggles don't count as a defiance of worthiness to the outside world, so it did not count to me though my self-worth has been going up in flames for a while recently. I do not seek attention or pity for it; it is just what trials I am faced with in this season. But I am trying to learn to see myself the way God does as I work to become better and love and forgive myself and how I have responded to living with other people's mistakes and life-changing choices that have been less than positive. I really needed to connect with this song today; thank you."

One of the most beautiful music videos I've seen lately.
"Listening to this, I have a kind of mashup between Light - Sleeping at Last and Sleeping At Last - ""You Are Enough"" playing through my head, and I wish it were real because I cannot make it. But especially the ""you are enough"" and ""I promise ill do better."" Though I would maybe change it up at least at the end to say, ""I promise it gets better."" Both emotional and heart-pulling songs."
"I love how the landscapes and seasons are all different. It reminds me that no matter how much we change, hurt and grow as humans we are still so beautiful and loved. No matter what season or circumstance you are in, there is still wonder and beauty that you are still here. This video really encapsulates the beauty of the song. ðŸ’›"
47:05 - what is the name of the track?
"To anyone who's reading this, ITS GOING TO BE OK. I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, and the over thinking, and the doubt exit your mind right now and may clarity and understand replace confusion. I declare peace and calmness to fill your life."

"I have commented on quite a few of Abao's videos, and I wanted to comment on this one for the chance that I could one day see it again when using this video to study...again. I started using his study-with-me's to help motivate me to study all the way back when I was a sophomore in high school taking chemistry. That year was in the midst of COVID when most people were still in lockdown, but my school was hybrid. I struggled a lot to feel motivated when doing work online AND in school--it got very complicated...most of my teachers struggled to use zoom and teach online. Especially taking nearly six advanced classes at once, it got pretty hectic and tiring. But I pushed through that year, as well as my junior year, and now I am only 3 months away from graduating high school. Only a few days ago I was offered a full ride to my #1 university, and it is still hard for me to believe. Abao's study-with-me's not only ALWAYS helped me get through the mountains of school work I felt I always had, but they also are helping me to reflect back onto all the hard work I have put into my education, and in turn, into myself. I think many people here could relate when I say it is hard to feel academic validation when there is always more you could learn and there are always people who are smarter than you. Nonetheless, I am so grateful for how everything has turned out, even despite the hardships. Thank you, Abao!! I know that I am not the only person that your videos have had a profound impact on :) I am very very grateful for them and for your hard work that you put into them. They are the best study videos I have ever found on any platform. Much love to you, and I hope you are healthy and safe ðŸ¤"

"I am writing this while taking my break.
I guess i will use this comment as a checkpoint for myself. I know ill come back to this video on day or another.
So today i am at J-3 before the bac, i am quite confident for the physics and chemistery, i studied a lot for these subject. I am not so confident about svt thought, i studied a lot less because i always had good grades but looking at all the things i have to learn is making me stress. I though that I would de dead long before but i am now here writing this and studying. I think I will also see my english getting better hahaha...
I am now thinking of becoming a doctor but also hesitating a bit with studying engineering... Ill come back later to update (i think) cause the breack is finished"

"While I understand why you put ads in your videos now, I miss when there weren't ads... It's very distracting to be focused and suddenly get interrupted."
Having a real person to do study sessions with hits so different. There's people out here all across this Earth we're all living in just looking for a quiet place to study. Seeing all the different scenery somehow seems so far yet so close ðŸ’›
Keep that good mood on and I am all ready for studying or working.

"YES, I've had terrible experiences learning a language.  And the very first thing I always tell people that don't understand why I don't learn and that it is hard for me is that 1) hardly anyone speaks it to me and 2) nothing they say is comprehensible.  But when I sit at the relatives' houses and hear people speaking to their children, I understand almost everything they're saying.  But they won't speak to me, an adult male, the way that they speak to a child (with repetition and context).  So they go directly to the incomprehensible and it stays that way.  I actually understand the grammar better than many native speakers, but acquisition isn't there."

"A good summary, well done.  HOWEVER, one of the things I find that is TOTALLY overlooked by reviewers is how to stop a paid Subscriber from sharing their Course login details with their peers.  2FA is an option, as the paid Subscriber will probably get sick of their buddies calling them for an authorisation code every few days or so (as far as I can tell, none of these platforms offer 2FA anyway).  The ideal solution appears to be Digital Rights Management (where, as I understand, the viewer can only view the content if they have a proprietary viewer downloaded on their PC and there is some confirmation that the machine they are trying to view the content on has been properly registered as a paid platform). This type of technology seems to be very expensive though.  I would be interested to know if you have any thoughts regarding this.  After all, you can spend hundreds of hours creating Course content and it can be absolutely crushing if you find that people are piggybacking off their buddies login to gain access to Course content for free - a real grrrrrr moment. Thinkific seems to have the edge here. A major problem IMHO."

"When you only learn through input (aka passively) it generally means one thing = you're lazy.

When you learn only in an active, focused way, but neglect input, or passive learning = you're lack intrinsic motivation, you're not passionate.

You need passive learning as much as you need active learning. Learning is deeper and more durable when itâ€™s effortful. Learning thatâ€™s easy is like writing in sand, here today and gone tomorrow."

"I am going to learn filipino(Tagalog) because Iâ€™m going to travel and stay in the Philippines for my whole college career. 

I will be using many strategies, including:
1- learn basic vocabulary from duolingo or any other app
2- learn grammar (that Iâ€™m actually gonna use) from textbooks and youtube
3- watch filipino shows and movies
4- watch filipino YouTubers
5- listen to podcasts while walking 
6- listen to filipino music and actually understand the lyrics 
7- journal in filipino either by writing by hand or taking videos
8- follow filipino people on social media
9- communicate with family in Tagalog (and relatives once i reach the 3~4 month milestone)

Traps that i will avoid:
1/pushing myself too hard (especially when i have school)
- instead Iâ€™ll watch a cute show or movie at least
2/ going too easy on myself - make a suitable schedule everyday
3/ relying on myself too much - talk to people

Iâ€™ll keep myself accountable by:
1- reminding myself of what will happen if i dont try my best in learning Tagalog but at the same time remind myself of the wonderful opportunities thatâ€™ll come to me when i try hard and learn (ØªØ±Ù‡ÙŠØ¨ ÙˆØªØ±ØºÙŠØ¨)
2- Iâ€™ll reward myself each month 

Since finals are close i will be spending my time learning on doulingo only, to learn basic words till i hit at least the 100 vocab milestone or till i finish my finals and start incorporating more strategies when summer break starts."

Threading in Python just exists to write simple non-blocking code like for an UI. The potential speed up here comes from sleep not using the interpreter for a while so the GIL is not a problem here. A real program that constantly needs to execute code on the interpreter would not benefit from this at all. For real parallel processing use multiprocessing. Its faster because it actually runs several interpreters

But I also donâ€˜t think that Iâ€˜m the target audience soâ€¦. It basically reads like a standard action blockbuster movie. 

As for Grady Hendrix. I recommend My Best Friends Exorcism over The Final Girls Support Group. Itâ€™s about female friendship and full of cheesy 80s references. 
I love Grady Hendrix but I think if youâ€˜re not a big horror movie fan heâ€˜s more of a hit or miss. 
He loves to hide horror related Easter eggs in his stories or straight up references a lot of classic horror films and itâ€˜s really fun (for example the characters in The Final Girl Support Group are basically the final girls from classic slasher movies like Halloween or Texas Chainsaw)."

Btw, I feel like you would also like ""When I sing, the mountain dances"" by Irene SolÃ , it came out at the same time than Permafrost and it's great: very lyrical and nature-focused, where the forest itself is a character of the novel, as well as everything in it (I mean there's a chapter with plate tectonics...)"

But when the united states government ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ does exactly this in weaker countries in some cases stated war's under false conditions for natural resources  it's ok. 

Yeah ok ðŸ‘Ž"
fake news
So in other words they are similar to the CIA for America
"I just could not contain my laughter after hearing what James E. Smith had to say about Wagner. This hypocrite of a man thinks that everything Wagner is doing and has done is evil and everything Blackwater or Xe or Academi has done is good. But there is nothing further from the truth, if he could just be honest and not hypocritical for just one minute. Blackwater has been known to commit egregious murders in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and many other places they have operated, including Libya and Syria. They were responsible for ensuring oil fields were safe for the exploitation of American companies in Iraq. They have done the same thing in Libya. And they are doing the same thing in Syria. But if you go by what Americans always do and think, they are always the good guys and everybody else is the bad guy. Just the way Americans always think. They are quick to point to the twig in the eyes of others while ignoring the hardwood 2x4 in theirs! Sick people!"
"People cannot be fooled anymore.Everything Russia is doing in Ukraine ,they copied from America.;the difference,Russi is more humane"
"this is more like america does, what are this fools talking about, americans are not saviors, americans are invasors and killers. Thiefs of gold, diamonds and resourses."
"This is amazing!!! European and American butchers who have killed tens of thousands of Serbs, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, tens of thousands of Libyans, hundreds of thousands of Syrians, claim crimes and pretend to be saints.. The West has blood on its hands, like maniacs!!!"
"*To sum it up, Wagner is a militia that needs financial gains to exist.* 
*Is its existence based on giving a glow of hope to governments and countries that are devastated by the USA?*"
"Actually, Russia and US divided the whole world for stole their resource just like this part for you and that part for us. The US makes Russia as a threatened country for Europe to make money. The same thing they did with Iran for Saudi. if you look at Latin America there is no conflict or war because there is not many more natural resource. If your country has resources take note that US or Russia or the EU will come to establish peace there today or tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. and this is their first step for stealing ur resources....."
so what about black water?? what about 100000 kills in Irag and Afganistan???
"Can anyone here make an analogy with Blackwater ?!?!? Or the Russians are always the most bad guys ...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydm1-xShndM"
"everything the WSJ accuses the Wagner group is doing, the USA government is guilty of"
Just like the foreign Terrorist group CIA
Soros news papper make video..:OmG USA UK is a evil and devil on this earth!!!
"Actually, other nations are waiting for the Wagner group to help them fight the globalists."
"LOL from the start the lies and the propaganda is obvious. How is Wagner different from Black Water? Yes, Wagner have morals, Black Water dont."
Just like the foreign Terrorist group CIA and MOSSAD
Fk propaganda. Let Russians tell us about Wagner and you tell us about failed Mozart and whether they are regrouping somewhere and lastly when are they going to get war schooling in Russia
US hypocrisy is disgusting... shame on you
how many of black water bustard get punishment for their crime
American has the same.Itâ€™s called the Blackwater only the  Wagner is more effective.This documentary is part of western media propaganda
Every powerful nation in history is guilty of such acts.
So what if Russia using mercenaryâ€™s talk about the USA Israel and Briton
The americans are mad because they copied their idea
They learned how to do it from Americans :)

"It's cringe because you can literally take this documentary and replace anger with us military and it's the exact same thing, killing and torchering civilians stealing oil, pillaging. Same thing."
"Why have you not done a report on Black Water? Which is a real Mercenary Group! How about the hundreds of people that they Killed. Ah, yes the double standard. Propagandistic bull............."

"whAT is CIA, space agency of US they do shadow business of spying, then  get data and use the data to other countries. US is the most SPUY network country in the world ."

"Way over rated band. All Dave does is yell and scream and play slash chords. The drummer, despite his tragic death, was a serious drug addict who needed help. Grohl should have come out and preached against drug abuse and acknowledge that that is what killed his friend and drummer. Grohl is melodramatic in his performance, plus the tunes all sound the same:Boring.
This band is like a cheap version of Nirvana. Grohl is a good drummer, I will give him that. Foo Fighter as a band: 2 out of 5. Grohl as a frontman: 4 out of 5."

"Why there's depression and why we can't live happily all the time?

Because that is not the nature of worldly life. God has not made this wordly life to stay forever. So even if we would have suffered from happiness disorder still we'd have to Die!!! The nature of this world is this temporariness, God has made it to test humans that which of us really deserve heaven, the eternal place of joy and love. He gave us free will to choose our actions, he gave us intelligence to contemplate about life, he gave us heart to recognise our true reality and its relationship with God. 

Some times we invite depression anxiety due to our own faulty way of thinking while at other times suffering is inevitable. Although it is painful to go through it, but we can evolve into better human beings. They make us more sincere, kind. They remove hidden arrogance of our ego. 

Heartbroken hearts are kinder towards others hearts. God didn't made us tk suffer all along, He made human beings to live eternally. God's mercy is for everyone but We ourselves create a barrier between his mercy and ourselves through arrogance, vain pride, evil, etc. 

Sufferings break all those barriers. And once there's no barrier between you and God then eternal joy awaits you.

"They really missed their regular second guitarist Dom here.  Shade gave a good effort but he understandably wasn't playing the harder parts that Reba and Dom wrote on more recent tracks.  That led to some awkward changes to the songs.  Mix was rough too, but not a huge surprise.  On the plus side, the Dreams 1+2 combination was neat."

"Trina wears her wampum beads
She fills her drawing book with line
Sewing lace on widows' weeds
And filigree on leaf and vine
Vine and leaf are filigree
And her coat's a secondhand one
Trimmed with antique luxury
She is a lady of the canyon
Annie sits you down to eat
She always makes you welcome in
Cats and babies 'round her feet
And all are fat and none are thin
None are thin and all are fat
She may bake some brownies today
Saying, you are welcome back
She is another canyon lady
Estrella, circus girl
Comes wrapped in songs and gypsy shawls
Songs like tiny hammers hurled
At beveled mirrors in empty halls
Empty halls and beveled mirrors
Sailing seas and climbing banyans
Come out for a visit here
To be a lady of the canyon
Trina takes her paints and her threads
And she weaves a pattern all her own
Annie bakes her cakes and her breads
And she gathers flowers for her home
For her home she gathers flowers
And Estrella, dear companion
Colors up the sunshine hours
Pouring music down the canyon
Coloring the sunshine hours
They are the ladies of the canyon"

"Cat moms and dads, you have to do better at keeping these little hairless guys clean. It means the world. World of difference between peace of mind and trying to dig a hole in the head because these things are crawling around getting on the nerves."
I thought cotton buds were explicitly *NOT* for cleaning ears?  For years we have been told not to use them for such due to the high risk of dealing permanent damage to the ear drum.
"My cat: [scratches her ears]
YouTube:"
Never use cotton buds in ears.
Til ear mites exist
Bro I bet that felt so good
weâ€™ve had to do this with my dog since she was a baby
"As a Sphynx owner, cleaning his ears is so important! Once every few days with a wipe, quick and easy ðŸ’— a general body wipe down between baths is good too to avoid build up :-)"
Mmmm would not be surprised to learn that this cats breeder was not taking proper care of their animals.
my cat got blood in his ears from a cut and i had to clean it out. he was not calm. my stepdad had to hold him down with thick gloves on cuz he was squirming so much
Grown adults still need care just like this pets are super lucky!
Clean your pets ears!! Please!
"All it takes is a perfunctory look in the ear to see all the dirt and wax. Itâ€™s not as if it needed a camera down the ear to see all the gunk, it was living at the top. I donâ€™t see why the owner didnâ€™t see all this!"
Yeah I been cleaning grounds out daily for 4 months no signs of easing up
shit someone deep clean my ear like that iâ€™d be kicking my leg too
Why don't we have the same sanitation standards for our pets as we do ourselves.?
Lord beerus in his baby days ðŸ«¡
This was a everyday job on the farm as a kid ! All kinds of animals get these if you use warm olive oil it will also help prevent them from coming back ðŸ˜Š
My dog had the same thing going on thankfully only one ear and she got better very quick
"My stupid vet,didn't even take a sample  to see what's going on inside the ears.. but they told me that cats are having dark vax and that's normal.. well I still don't know if my cat is having food alergy or mites .."
"If you buy your cats the flea preventative revolution and give it to them every month, their chances of getting an ear mite infection/infestation is very low and you don't need to do the ear ointment for 3 weeks; you instead give them drops for 1 to 2 weeks and give them an extra dose of revolution right behind the ear so it can kill them. Though it depends on how bad the infection is."
I know my cats hate when I clean their ears but I still do it for this exact reason
Who would have a cat like that and be too trifling to care for it properly.
"I babysat my in law's cats for about 6 months once, and one was so skittish and sensitive. I finally got her warmed up to me though (she was sleeping in my arms even) and one've the first things i did as soon as she would let me was clean her poor ears really good! She had a history of ear problems but her parents never cleaned them!! She was soo much happier afterwards, i couldn't believe how much less grouchy and finicky she became almost immediately. Not all cats need much in the way of ear cleaning, it's very much dependent on location, but for sure check their ears and step in if there's buildup!!! Especially if you live somewhere dusty!!!!!"
Mmmmmaybe I shouldnâ€™t have my cats sleep in my bed anymore
"Imho, there's no such thing as a cute Sphinx."
I need to check out my animals!!ðŸ˜¢
I just had to use a little drop of medicine between her shoulders once and my baby was cured?
Babys so cute
Its a rat
"Ear mites are pretty common in cats and are _""usually""_  easy to clear up with proper treatment. However,  PLEASE do not just start digging into your cat's ears with Q-tips at home"
Love that people are spending thousands on an animal they dont know how to properly care of
Couldnâ€™t you cause damage to the tympanic membrane doing this?
Using Revolution will get rid of ear mites without all the ointment and cleaning for 3 weeks
What's that ointment content?!ðŸ¤” What are other things used?!
Those kitties should be able to fly... like Dumbo.

Did the owner not know how to look after a cat before getting one? Like is this not a basic thing you should do regularly when cleaning your pets?
Bro just cleaned lord beerus's ear ðŸ—¿
That prob felt so good
I HAVE A HAIR LESS CAT RAT TO!!!
The cat was obviously thrilled when they started to wash its ears and scratch it. Itâ€™s foot was going ðŸ˜‚
"A little headsup, dont swab your pets ears by yourself!! Always let the vet do it cause you might break their eardrums"
Poor baby.
As soon as I saw the debris in the ear I knew what it was.
I never had this problem with any cat I've had in my life. How does this happen?? My cats went outside all the time and this is the first time I've seen this. It's disgusting that the poor kitty had to endure such a torture to have earmites ðŸ˜®
"I did that a lot with my cats, over the years. As soon as they start scratching their ears, one reflex: mite alert!!"
I used to find these cats scary looking but recently I think theyâ€™re just so cute
Why is it inside out
God dam I'm trying to eat here!
Such a sweet calm cat.
"Fuck ear mites 
They hurt the fur babies"
NEVER put buds into an ear.   Cat dog or otherwise.    Ridiculous tip.
"Im gonna check all of my 10 cats ear now,nnnnðŸ˜®ðŸ˜® thats a lot of ears to clean!"
Poor baby.... ear mites are so very itchy for kitty's! Why didn't the owner check the kitty's ears your supposed to clean hairless cats regularly including their ears because they have oil and dirt buildup from our hands touching them! I hope that poor kitty is better!! â¤â¤â¤
My labradoodle had very dirty ears. No mites from what I remember but she was an outside dog and would sleep in the loose dirt so her ears would get yucky. She would lay her head in my lap and just let me clean out her ears. She loooooved the massaging with the cleaner. I miss that dog so much.
- Awee that poor cat ðŸˆ ðŸ˜» ðŸˆâ€â¬›ï¸
How do indoor pets get infested with insects...
you can see his feet doing the scratch when he was massaging its ears lol
"I remember my cat had ear mites at some point
They just put something on the nape of his neck and they never came back"
I swear every sphinx kitten I see has bad ears
Untreated ear mites can cause permanent deafness.
Thankyou for helping so many animals!
I check my cats ears a few times a month and keep cleaning wipes on hand if there's any excessive build up of wax or anything. Luckily she has a lot of fluff in her ears which protect them from excessive dirt buildup so I rarely have to clean them out.
How do u fix that if ur animal is extremely stressed and won't let you do it? God people really are judgemental makes me sick hopefully y'all and ur pets live a perfect life
"LoL whenever I see these types of cats ,iam thinking this cat has some sort of skin diseases ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚"
I wish I could've done more for our other cat but I was just a kid. Ear mites suck.
Should we apply ointment daily after the ear wax is removed or we should chek daily if wax or dirt is still there?
"There's no such thing as a ""cute Sphinx Cat"""
oh poor angel babe ðŸ˜¢ this owner is neglectful...that is what id expect from an abandoned stray kitty suffering on the streets! You can get your cat a sweater but not clean her poor ears!?!?
Its weird what people steal on the internet
I WANT THIS BEBE!

Do not put Q-tips in ears of any kind!!!

The second thing i question is that he always broadcasting about and i quote...all the b*iches he and his brother F*cked.
He pretends to be a Muslim but as a good Muslim a man isn't allow to even shake the hand of another woman...Ever seen Habib(MMA #1)or his brother Islam shake hands with a woman.

"Broooo. This is really good but I want to see the BBC do this about America too. They are the global West's lead representative. They  are one of if not still the richest country EVER on earth but they too have border smuggling issues, they too have insane amout of  homeless people starving to death and sleeping in the streets in MULTIPLE cities not just one, drug deaths not just for the poor but also in their richest cities, plus they have a HUGE issue with crime. Do you see how full their jails are? You hardly do deep dives into their mass murders and mass shootings because you don't want it recordered in history. Imagine if that was in North Korea? We'd get these well financially backed docomentaries every few months like you do with other nations. What makes it worse is Americas government doesn't give two shits about their citizens ðŸ˜‚ They are sending billions to war while their citizens are dying in the streests, homeless, starving and drug addicted AS WE SPEAK. But no reporting on that because these types of videos are literally the writing of history. My grand kids and their kids after will watch videos like this to try understand what was happening geopolitically and if its from the BBC, 60 Minutes, AP etc some may take it as fact how strong the names of these media outlets are. Not doing videos like this on America is erasing a crucial part of history documenting their great empires downfall!"
Thatâ€™s so funny. First he claims he can take those docs. Then spouts out about Clintonâ€™s emails and Bill Clintonâ€™s sock drawer. Then he states in an audio that he never declassified them.

"A great invention for the current lack of creativity. Even before the manufacture of the typewriter and the computer, great writers wrote their great works and I A nobody will give you the gift of creating a great work because either you are born with the gift or you learn to be ordinary with the help of something outside of you. We are in the time when people are on the net, they don't interact live, they are critical for youtuber but not for reality. Great innovations such as the creation of cloned sheep, plagiarism of a work, imitation of a natural talent, copying what already exists, have been new. History will tell. We are specializing in REPETECO, in IMITATING WHAT WE ARE, as if we were a bunch of ignorant people applauding everything that resembles us in terms of intelligence and induces us to an enormous laziness at a time when everyone is on the internet, leaving natural cognition aside that have. To read such nonsense, since the fashion now is to let children be raised on the net giving them the latest fashionable cell phone, I suggest we make a bunch of GPT or AI children for them to read because we don't want our brains to be replaced by clones of our cognitive power of creation. it reminds me of cloned sheep and reminds me of copies of paintings by famous painters, parodies of hit songs... Do you want to imitate us? create food for and good wages for all and leave it to robots and AI to build a repetitive and uncreative tomorrow or build child robots and make them ""listen"" to it 24 hours a day. Cognition makes us creative and non-repetitive, although some human beings are enthralled by the cloned sheep, the parodied music, the counterfeit or imitated work of art, the plagiarism of plagiarism, repetitive music. We are the surprise and the new and for that we don't even depend on cognition only, but on being non-static and our creativity unpredictable because the Creator Engineer of Life made us free by the principle of FREE WILL, when GOD could have created us as obedient robots and He didn't create it that way. And that's why the fallen angels rebelled because they wanted to be like men, free and freed and they hate our condition of (free) being GOD's Maximum Work. Progress brought I A and the GPT chat, replacing the inability of those without a gift to create news and that's a good thing, because before history recorded that those without the ability to think from different angles condemned intelligent people, and with a vision totally opposite to theirs contemporary contemporaries, the loss of civil rights, or the stake, then social banishment. Yes, we are in times that we lack great men and women with the capacity for criticism, just look at the works of those who have passed on EARTH, and whose criticality in the Nazis' plans was just as Charles Chapelin ironized the conquest of the world by hittler (it won't be written with a capital letter).... We are going to a dangerous time and people are not realizing it."

Coding
Where do you learn all this code from
WHERE TO CODE THIS ALL PLS ANSWER ?
"tbh i ALWAYS brought the ""browns"" lol"
My strat is to get the light blues as quickly as possible and houses quickly. Pretty op start. Try to also get the set of oranges or something along these ranges to extend.
That ass slap took the air from my lungs
Please which app did you use
still not gonna buy the greens
This strategy is insane. AI is insane. Monopoly is insane. I am insane.
Ursins module not found
The reason I don't like Monopoly is that I can't prevent other players from making deals that hand the game to one of them.
"One thing that stands out is to remember that 7 is the most common roll in a set of 2 dice. and a roll of 6, 7, or 8 has about a 44% chance of occurring. With how often people go to jail, it makes capitalizing on the red and orange properties great, since there is a high chance they will land on those properties once out of jail. Very cool how the AI was able to notice this."
Browns are super good early game imo. They really help out with snatching the GO money from other players and help you amount wealth faster too.
Again amazed by the compactness of the code. Now libraries make everything so convenient! (Reminded me the old day of flash...)
"Hey, how do you learn this stuff? Do you copy the code from somewhere? I am just confused how one learns how to do this on their own. Do you have help? Explain how plz. Thanks"
Give code please haha
Hey can you send the image of bird for downloading or  send link
Itâ€™s really cool seeing neural networks learning to play more complex games.  Iâ€™m still holding out for the time that I find a video of one learning to play _PokÃ©mon._
havenâ€™t watched the video yet hope the AI buys the browns to control he housing market and prevent other players from buying houses
"Stay in jail, as long as you can."
"How to check that an entity is touching some object?
with Entity.intersects that dont work"
This was one of the coolest Videos ever
"Selection of the ""best"" properties is significantly influenced by the chance of landing on that property. Might explain why the first railroad was the AI's favourite."
I must say most of my monopoly wins was holding the browns and blues this is my corner... I hardly lost at monopoly
this app name pls
"New start:
No one trades - so the game can't end.
Everyone are waiting for the first person to give up and quit,
The moment a person quits everyone are trying to buy the sets they can get from the smart person who left, that way a player can get an advantage without helping somone else"
All of that analysis to show that humans play well naturally?
"I guess people are still better than AI.
I confirmed what the best properties are in under 10 games.
Orange and red which ever I collect the fastest at all cost.
Followed by dark blue.
Then yellow and green.
Trains are ok early but you won't win without a good color set to go with them."

"I once played a game where I had both browns, the only monopoly on the board, and held several key properties that prevented others from getting the  monopoly that they wanted.  I was winning quite handedly until I had to go to work, and my sister took over for me.  She made all the trades and, in a couple few rounds, was knocked out of the game.  I sternly believe, had she kept playing as it was when I left would have won."
Browns? Those aren't brown they're supposed to be purple.
It's working
Every time I loose I loose on the Browns
I like to code 2 i have started to learn it but 2 many lines are for me not easy at all. This game seems 2 easy but when u write the code and try to understand that is the difficulty
"I always bought the browns, super cheap and you're getting hotels quick. It's like go collect 200 tax on the others.  3 landing and you paid it off"
After 2 years of learning python i see how it is easy 2 years ago you motivated me to learn python and many of languages
Never knew its that easy to create a game

Sir in phone which app
8/10 it's virtually the same game as last year... & the year before that... & the year before that... & the year...
"Why has not a single reviewer, including this one, given us any feedback on the state of VR in the game? This is the only significant new feature to appear in the the game last year and this year. We need to know!"
"It's too arcadey, there's zero weight to the cars so they just look like they're gliding over the track. There's very little suspension movement, tyre deformation is non-existent and the wings don't flex under load. The technology to simulate all of that has been around for years too so there's no excuse as to why the models are static."
"In summary then, it's a bit shite ðŸ˜„"
"1. Fixing last year handling & adding a new track is no more than a 19$ DLC. They ask 120$ for the same game. Crazy!!!

2. No PSVR2 while PC has it & while an older game like GT7 has it. That's really a BIG shame. 

3. Let's make an experiment for EA & Codemasters: let's give them couple of photos side by side from f1 23 & 22, & see if they can guess which is the new one. 

4. It certainly looks they are keeping their efforts for next year new engine. So I will do the same & save my efforts & money."
"Look at that, only three days too late"
TLDR USED A CONTROLLER.  OPINION IRRELEVANT
"Not worth 70â‚¬, wait for a sale."
PC VR Mode !!! And no PSVR 2 ? What a mess !!!!! Iâ€˜ll wait for F1 24 maybe EA change their minds
When we getting the F1 season montage
Good explanation â€¦â€¦..but your driver skills is toddler level â€¦
feel bad for all the multiplayer guys u need mega legendary upgraded car to win so pay up ðŸ˜†
After paying 60euros for the 22 piece of s@# no way. Maybe on a huge sale in the future
paid $90 no FFB smh {TMX PRO}
only reason to play f1 games is race other humans online. the most competition will obviously be on F1 23.
â€œBut I have no creative control over what I say in this video. â€œ  - I know you mis poker but I stopped here. No interest in hearing the opinion of someone who canâ€™t be fuckdd to review their own review .
"They should of kept the turning in on you coding for the dive bomb overtakes that are really popular vs AI, I just feel if the AI didn't move outta the way to reward overtakes like that, people would drive better in general against humans"
How does 1 apply to become an eSports seriers racer? I have lots of full length races to showcase my driver capabilities.
"So I've owned and played all F1 games from F1 2018 to F1 '23.
I bought this based off the handling, breaking point 2, Qatar and red flags.
But below is a lengthy dive into my honest views of the game and whether you should get it or not.
Always make your own opinions, mine is my own and is just shared to give those wondering or on the fence, some further insight;

Breaking Point 2.
The story is alright, not shit, not amazing, but all the characters feel real and you can get behind alot of them through the game.

The difficulty is broken into ;
Story, which a toddler could finish... Normal, which is the difficulty I played, where the A.I arent fast but brake super super early all the time.
Hard which is about 50 A.I difficulty.

The mode is good, but not great and lacks unique gameplay that they could have used and most of the second season while that's the peak of the story, also feels the most generic.

                 F1 World.
F1 World offers alot, it's primary issue is it feels like it holds your hand too much for too long.
You spend alot of time being the fastest car by about 50-100 Tech Level and it's too easy for a while.

However the mode has some great innovations to the game.
It's a complete overhaul to Multiplayer in general and is the home of all forms of it.
You aren't forced to run only the F1 World car but you can also get into F1 2023 and F2 2022 cars.

Tech Level is a new measure of a ""Gear System"" in racing games. Different and unique. You can upgrade a bunch of parts and build some, but you can't really demote yourself with weaker parts unless you keep older stuff meaning you can overshoot some events and be too fast when you come back.

Time Trial and Grand Prix modes were also moved into F1 World and we actually have the addition of Multiplayer Grand Prix mode.

        Career, Co-Op and MyTeam.
Probably the biggest disappointment of the entire game, is the fact that neither of these 3 modes has had any development over F1 2021 and F1 '22.
They aren't stale by any means, as we all know driver moves, semi custom calendars and the likes can really change from season to season, player to player and you will always have a unique experience.
But it's a shame that none of the modes have had the love and attention they do deserve.

               New Features.
F1 '23 is home to a slew of new things that you would have missed in F1 '22, F1 2021 and F1 2020.
If you're an F1 2020 player, then you have little reason to want to move onto any of the 3 save for the tracks.
F1 '23 has two new tracks with Losail International in Qatar, and Las Vegas as the 3rd U.S GP in the game.
On top of these, F1 2021 tracks China and Portugal return for the third year running, and Frances, Paul Riccard remains even after 2022 was it's final contracted year.

Away from the tracks, F1 2020 will still have the Classic F1 cars for those few who did enjoy and use them.
2021 removed them, and F1 '22 added Supercars which have returned in F1 '23 but no new additions and they aren't heavily promoted.

As with the Supercars, the F1 Life features in F1 '22 have returned, yes that's right, you can customise your very own couches in F1 '23.
They're in but they're not heavily pushed, they aren't marketed everywhere and pretty much everything from F1 '22s F1 Life is in without having to buy them, spend pitcoin etc. So if you liked that customisation, then lucky you.

The handling.
Yeah, as many YouTubers have noted, the handling is a shitload better, if you have '22, this alone is worth it.
Those coming from F1 2020/2021, unless you want to get your hands on the new cars after all this time, handling is about equal to the F1 2020 game in terms of easiness and intuitiveness.
The handling in F1 '23 however is much more realistic to life over the older games, except a few moments here and there such as the race launches.

Red flags are finally back in F1 but yes, heavily bugged right now, but as this is a leading feature I absolutely expect this to be patched very soon.

Damage model.
Unfortunately the damage in '22 is the damage in '23
This to be fair and honest, is not the fault of Codemasters or EA and is a limitation of the license with the FOM.

35% Race Distance is here and offers more racing over the 11-16 laps of 25% and the 24-33 laps of the 50%

This is about all I can think of.
My own personal opinion is if you're happy staying on the more dated F1 2020 or 2021, stay there until more patches come through then pick F1 '23 up later in the year.
If youre coming from F1 '22, don't hesitate, just get F1 '23 because the difference in the two is like comparing F1 2017 with F1 2020."
"players are not in cockpit view mode, that's cheating"
"My GPU also maxes out in the menus. And it's an AMD GPU, so not related to brand."
"It's like Football Manager, when they do the tweaks to fix a bug or change a font, or background colour and claim it is a new feature. Yearly games are just not going to make wholesale changed year on year, and they know players will still buy"
"question is, when will they bring back historic cars"
"""On every level"".... You haven't seen what it looks like on my PC! A complete blurry mess! Maybe my PC isn't up to spec (AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D / RX 7900XT). Trees are ""shimmering / smearing"" and have objects showing through them like buildings on the opposite side of the map.. braking boards are fuzzy right until you get close to them to name just a few glaringly obvious problems. I would love to know what the BETA testers were doing while they had this game to test!"
Game is amazing. Looks fantastic and sounds even better!
Brakes are so annoying u can't late brake for an overtake. I also found a problem when I first played the game the car would slide with traction control on full which I was confused by but my major problem i have is braking cause I also run in deep but if I brake before the braking zone I lose time and am very slow
"Been playing F1 games since Microprose GP (the first...), but I'm going to skip this one unless it goes to sale for like 8.99 or so. Feels more and more like a game where they want to look cool rather than realistic. And the price, my God... I got a decent job so I *could* afford it but to ask such a premium for a fricking game which is merely an update to previous years... c'mon. That's just Evil A**holes EA at work. ðŸ˜•"
Anyone watching this as it installs?
"But why, why, why did they screw over the force feedback? Not going to spend time on an arcade game"
I started a 2 player career and it goes on â€œequal performanceâ€ of all cars. How to it change this?
In my opinion f123 is a pure joke.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ’©
Itâ€™s pronounced â€œDevunâ€ as in the English county not Devon.
Next make Fight Night.
"Just clown stuff. 50% races......... Drivers using game exploits.........
Just a yoke"
Ah yes Luke aka The GOAT ReviewerðŸ‘‘
I think we will see the games become much much better when they stop supporting Old Gen Consoles
F1 is the FIFA of the racing industry...gotta push out a new game yearly and watch the value drop instantly.
Underwhelming season.
"The driver names are on ffs, no sim guy would have this on, no sim guy would play this bollocks game.

It's not made for noobs and it's not made for simmers, so who the hell is this game for?"
"4090 at 100%, be sure to turn off the crypto mining on F1 23 settings ðŸ˜‚.

The traction in F1 22 isn't player friendly, I like it's super punishable throttle handling it's kind of unrealistic but I find it fun and challenging. 2020 2021 for me is still the best in handling.
F1 22 AI is literally online lobby simulator, they have cheaty exit grips, they don't leave you space and more.
F1 23 AI is the same as the old one.

F1 23 you still can't use the Monza turn1 run off."
"I knew not to buy it this year, its literally a re skin of F1 22 bar a couple of things, and for the pricing its not worth it."
What the hell are these camera views he is using. Eeesh :/
qualifying is not bugged it is scripted. and it is because AI does not actually have any attributes they are hard coded into the game
"Great review man! Kinda sad, but I might need to skip this one or wait for sale. As a career player mainly, doesnâ€™t look like I need to run out and grab this one."
"This is how the true emotion looks like when you become the world champion, THE WORLD CHAMPION! The massive work of long years finally paid off for Lucas. Congrats to Frederic too, he was so close, just like Thomas, an absolutely fantastic rookie. If I had to dream for the upcoming years, I would give the WDC win for Rasmussen in 2023 and for Ronhaar in 2024 - they both deserve a title in their career. But this is Blakeley's time - enjoy your win and I wish all of you a Merry Christmas! Now let us we all have a rest - rooting for a similar season of 2023 incoming! GG, guys."
Psvr2 it and I'll think about it.
"18:05 It's been obvious for a couple of years now that Codemasters QA is miserable. And I mean no offense but it is. They either lack personal to do it right or the personal they have are not competent. But of course they ask the premium price for a bug fest that will be on life support through it's year life span. 
BTW most of this stuff will never get fixed. There's X number of bugs that carried from 2021 to 2022 and never got fixed. I'm growing tired of this company and their lack of quality control over their product."
ben had to  restart his my team after 2 races due to a bug
There is a major bug from f1 2021 and 22 on series x/s where if u quick resumed the game everything would reset.  I lost many career saves and had to make car setupâ€™s to many times and redo all my settings.  If this is still there then this will be three years in a row
"Looks like its a great game to play, even though F1 WORLD, the secondary career mode is basically 4/10.


F1 23 is 8.8/10. Thanks Luke Reilly and EA!"
L review.
The physics are by far the worst I've experienced in the last 10 years  the onboard car audio engine are the worst too date my recommendation is to wait for the price to come down  -2019 18 and 13 are the best three F1 games I have enjoyed to date EA need to stop content creators Early Access shilling  this  epic fail of a game . You would like to think they would have taken a leaf out of the devs  book of gt7  I'll leave at that
Donâ€™t know if itâ€™s just me but I canâ€™t race in the wet in time trial
"Are they all running an open diff? It sounds like a one tyre fire out of every corner. 
Not a player myself, but just wondering, since it sounds very unlike f1 in real life."
For me I prefer the 22 handling on pad it's nice that you can catch slide easier but I absolutely hate the fast steering on the straights it feels so unrealistic
"Happy to hear an optimistic review of the ""F1 World"" features. I had no idea what to expect from this title, since F1 2020 is the last one I played before this installment"
"If anybody here is looking for a review from an avid f1 gamer, I can assure you that f1 23 is a big step up from 22. The handling is so much better, just completed a 35% race at Qatar and the car didn't have any moments at all, including understeer. I barely touched f1 22 but I can already tell this game will receive similar hours to f1 2020 and f1 2021. I couldn't be more happy, even though career mode hasn't been changed, it's nice to have an f1 game again with driveable cars. Hope this helps."
Now hopefully Codemasters can focus on getting WRC 23 launched.
Thanks for this detailed review.
"If you try and catch up on the real-world calendar in Grand Prix mode on 3-lap or 5-lap races, even if you went from last to first and doing all sorts to get Driver of The Day, it still shows your selected driver. On my save, the commentators would say that it's Alex Albon since race 2. It is still the case when I switched the commentary into another language.  Funny that."
It is more important to get the game out on market than to get the game completely patched
Not sure if anyone is talking about this but in TT there is no wet TT so you can't test wet setups unless you go into Grand Prix mode and set the weather to full wet and do a practice/quali session with it.
"why do f1 reviews NEVER talk about fov and camera customization options? it's always been an issue in f1 to get a camera position for a sim rig, the seat never moves far enough forward"
EA is gonna remove his access to the game lmao
Luke Reilly review ðŸ‘€? I'm in!
Thanks for the info broðŸ‘âœŒ
"I hate these early reviews where he didnâ€™t finish the story mode, couldnâ€™t play online to test servers, and has no clue whatâ€™s not being fixed after the day one patch ðŸ¥´ why call this a review at all ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¾"
"The rev counter in Grand Prix mode is still broken, and has been since 2020."
I have never watched F1 Esports but wow that looks so real I'm confused
"I have the champions edition , no bugs and im really loving the game"
"â€œInitiate the planâ€ 

Leaves game â€¦ 

â€œMission successâ€"
I'm a bit annoyed that the my team is a cut and paste but the rest of the game seems OK easier to handle more to do etc ....what are your thoughts???
"how do you do a custom online season with friends, on demand, now? we hopped in f1 world but it didnâ€™t seem like it saved progress after the session ended, and league racing was only set to certain times on race net?"
I have 37 hrs on this game ðŸ˜­
Like F1 games a lot but Iâ€™m saving my racing juice for Forza Motorsport this fall ðŸ˜®
I would argue that this title is one of the greatest in YouTube history.
4:35. Who is this guy? I can't recall my memory
"I spent the the extra money to get the early access. I couldnâ€™t be more disappointed. The handling feels super crappy, and the engine sounds are worse that last years. Itâ€™s a major step back"
Wish add old classic cars bk v10s n v12s
1:16:12 That was so cringe
Playing 4k ultra graphics on pc and the distance is so Blurry... Compared to the 2020..looks like shit.
red flag bug sounds like f1 2021 rear wing massive feature which was stripped out at launch
"Thanks for the good videos and honest opinions. I will wait to buy the game until its on discount, i just got F1 22 in December (my first ever F1 game) and im having a blast! Im still having tons of fun with it so ill give it another good 6 months and see how 23 is looking."
"Bought it and love the handling. Gave up pretty early on 22. I have a few concerns. I'm more an online racer, not too fussed about features, but for me anyway, the game atm seems very de sync prone. Could be just me, but the racing is quite shocking at the moment as you are likely shafted by someone who's not even touching you or a simple touch leaves you glued to the other car(s) lol. Hopefully improved, but other than that, the new handling is lovely and career seems like fun with the AI improvements."
"Luke Reilly always been the best IGN REVIEWER. 10/10.


F1 23: 8.6/10. YOU'RE WELCOME F1 AND EA!"
"The tedium did me in with F1 World. The concept is so strong, and the idea of a slow, RPG like progression over time with an F1 car is so appealing, I wouldnt even mind the strange difficulty curve. But it almost immediately devolves into a half collect-a-thon, half recycling simulator that requires every single operation to be done manually. I felt like all my 15 minutes of racing was buying me in F1 World was 15 minutes of chores to do before the next race."
"It's actually quiet good, better than last years ðŸ‘better driving model and soon good on vr"
I played this game full on from 2018 to 2021 the 2022 sucked in my opinion i played it 24 hours only so i dont know if i should buy this one.
This needs to be in the 2023 intro 0:01
The Mercedes hitting the rev limiter in 8 gear at monza annoys me so much
Nobody is going to take your reviews on racing games seriously if the person playing it is new to racing.
Nothing says realistic like driving with a cam on top of the drivers helmet
"On the topic of handling, its more than just easier, it feels sooooo good. Also the tyre model is fantastic."
Anyone else have this problem- my logitech pro wheel feels like it has 0.5Nm and minimal FFB even if i put it at 11Nm. Wheel is updated with latest firmware and im playing on the PS5. Is this a known issue or is it my wheel?
I hope they race in Jeddah next season!
Why did they remove the Grand Prix and time trial mode? Now I gotta start a career mode if I just wanna do a random race
This and GT7 ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
26:12  formationâ¤
Will F1 esports ever do like a 15-16 race season
What track is this?
Donâ€™t really play racing games but click on every review cause this guy is the best ðŸ‘ðŸ¾
What on earth is that first 30 seconds? That's not even a non F1 player that's a straight up gaming novice. No credibility.
Oh this is a video game lol ðŸ˜‚ at first I was like uuuuh what the. I didn't know this actually exists. Cool though.
Many games are super easy for the first 2.5 hours tho
There are so many bugs. If you miss the parking spot on the formation lap you have no flashbacks for the whole race. Same race at Miami I finished 13th and for whatever reason i got disqualified after the race also AI is so inconsistent track to track and qualy to race
"Iâ€™m
Waiting on Motorsport sorry"
On the money with this one. .I felt scammed buying a slightly upgraded F1 22.
"Hi . After some help with F123 on PS5 , I can not get the OSD to edit in time trail mode have tried everything and made sure the filters were correct etc. I can get it to work in GP but not in TT? Latest patch/PS5 any help much appreciated ðŸ˜Š"
Look for other reviews then this. Pure trash from a channel that knows NOTHING about the series. The common theme I've seen from alot of other reviews and seen in this view is the graphics on track and its surroundings have dropped off a great deal and for next gen that's not good. So that common thread around all other reviews should be enough to downvote this video due to reading from a script handed to them by EA (you can add the nasty looking driving if you want more LOL)
Bern playing formula 1 games since 95 this is by far the worst I've ever experienced the engine audio is shocking  the worst in the franchise history. And the physics are too  nothing has changed  the only thing new are the 23 cars  it's an epic fail backwards I said EA would ruin this franchise when bought it EA have no intentions of making a Great Dane makeing it a great game they are disgusting company profit before people do not buy this game you will not enjoy it one bit my blood is boiling cuz I love F1 racing games . So I guess it's back to gt7 for now this F1 title is nothing close to a sim . the content creator of  this chanal needs to find something new too doo . As soon as I saw the racing line I knew what was coming next EA are a  disgusting company
I've pretty much turned off red flags after I drove my heart out to go from 10th to win the race only for the game to place me in 10th place. I drove my heart out that race. lol
Yeah Iâ€™m sorry but you lost all credibility by the 11 second mark. Taking that corner was just painful to watch. Iâ€™m sure the video took a lot of work to make but shoulda had someone else giving you footage of the game.
Why did they remove the Grand Prix and time trial mode? Now I gotta start a career mode if I just wanna do a random race
"Have to agree with the comment on blurry graphics in the distance.  It is terrible.  I used up my 5 free hours of this game just trying to tweak the graphics.

Simple fix, turn Post Processing to Low.  and turn off all motion blur and camera shake"
"Perhaps I'm not correct, but the cars that top out in 8th might be correct. Teams have to choose one ratio for the whole season. So perhaps those teams took a shorter ratio."
Thereâ€™s a story?ðŸ˜‚
the redflag things is unbelievableðŸ˜‚ 18:00
Is the splitscreen mode 60 fps?
Do they have full replays yet?
I hurt my voice for like three days after this race ðŸ˜‚
is this a Whites Only event ?
"EA should stop making a new f1 game every year if it's to have basically the same game with even the same bugs and just a few minor change. They should just patch and fix their current games properly and release dlc instead to add the new track, new calendar etc. I'm definitely not gonna buy that game full price, it doesn't worth it. I'll probably do like I did with the couple last one and wait until it's free on game pass"
"Btw what is with anti cheat detection? Couple of months ago, every F1 content creator and their cousin talked about how the lack of an anti cheat system was detroying the integrity of F1 esports and league racing, and that this would be the most important feature in the new game. Now nobody's even mentioning it. I assume there still is none. Did they at least announce that they are developing it?"
"For bad drivers like me there's a huuuuge glitch when you use the flashback function while in the rain, it literally floods the screen with rain particles and fps drops to like 2 wich makes almost impossible to press the button, thanks for the video Alex!"
F1 23 is basically like what f1 22 was supposed to be.
"What an honest review, thank you so much, really appreciate it ðŸ™ðŸ»ðŸ™ðŸ»ðŸ™ðŸ»"
I'm a bit annoyed that the my team is a cut and paste but the rest of the game seems OK easier to handle more to do etc ....what are your thoughts???
f1 world sucks its running the hamster wheel and paying for podium pass trick
"Great insightful review.

Itâ€™s the first F1 game Iâ€™ve bought for PC and invested in a starter wheel.
Feels great but as someone who is running around 89AI I totally agree with the F1 world stuff. Looked such a decent mode and yet it feels easy and repetitive. Anything over a 5 lap race is basically practice sessions."
"so , better than 22?"
"If the game has improved handling for people using controllers, why is the person playing it in the video doing such a poor job of driving the car?"
Wow if f1 would be like this â€¦ everyone on similar cars
"as someone whoâ€™s played since 2017: the major gameplay difference is in the super licence system, looks at least right now that it will make online racing a bit cleaner in public lobbies because people are now graded instead of just all put together. I donâ€™t use controller but theyâ€™ve finally put a controller steer scale adjuster in the settings, which is something i had wanted for a while and one of the reasons i ended up getting a wheelðŸ˜‚. should make racing against wheel players a lot easier. Handling is miles better than 22, id compare it to 20, where you can still very easily break traction but itâ€™s also very easy to find that limit. on the other hand i find that the braking has been made worse this year, no abs just feels slack and idk how else to describe it. The new F1 life system has been interesting so far, but is incredibly easy, even with the opponent car multiplyer turned to full. took me legit about 3 hours to get full gold everything. Braking points ok, donâ€™t see the point of it but itâ€™s well executed. overall itâ€™s a much more filled game than 22, much less buggy at launch and the cars feel a lot better. considering they were the same price at launch, 23 just feels like a better deal. Cons- Menu music but you can just turn that offðŸ˜‚"
"They should stop all this ""story mode"" / ""breaking point"" modes and concentrate on just RACING MODE!! Perhaps then they might find the major graphics bugs that I have found. Please give the license to someone like KUNOS who can make a purely F1 RACING GAME and not an ""Ikea shopping spree / Once upon a time"" off track ""game""!"
Pro tip: don't let EA take advantage of your interest for the sport just to sabotage you with an unfinished product. Most of their games are a steaming pile of Poo Poo CaCa
Does anyone know if crossplay microphones are fixed? I want to be able to talk with my friend on pc/ps4 without having to have a laptop beside me for discord. It's such a simple thing to do.
Actually feels nice u can finally use traction off on controller
It deserve a 9. Great review though
"itâ€™s kinda boring tbh cause thereâ€™s no drama, no crashes because everything is so polish and tidy because itâ€™s on the computer"
My brain would do the same thing as your 4090 if I was talking to Natalie. â¤
And if you are currently playing on F1 2020 with a controller. Should I buy it or nah?
Anyone tried it on a steam deck yet? the previous f1 22 game ran amazing on the steam deck
"Lucas will win 2023 as well. Then he will be history, just like each other champions."
"Score rhymes with Great, it got an 8 !"
The problem i have with this game for story mode and solo f1 world challenges it takes to long to get an actual challenge or everythingâ€™s just really easy. Ill finish 5 laps 40 seconds ahead and can do a pitstop and still finish 10 to 20 seconds ahead
Just love how the all lock up there tyres but nothing seems to happen ðŸ˜‚
I'm just glad that controller input's are better.
"What is this review OMG
Never gonna watch your channel again <3"
Red Bull wins every race or its broken.
I am not gonna buy it yet. The price is high for another unfinish game.
Maybe there is hope afterall.....
"The globe, space, evolution, dinosaurs, gravity, and then entire heliocentric model are all lies."
"Looks like your steering wheel is a good bit too far off from your body. Your arms are WAY too straighten out when toughing the wheel, can't imagine playing longer sessions with that positioning."
Race Start: 20:30.
Developers should take a closer look on the rendering engine. There is clear mishandling of gamma either on textures or the render itself. The black levels contrast between in track rendering and everything else out of it screams out loud! Itâ€™s easy to tweak it so it looks realistic.
"Oh damn, STILL the sprint tire glitch.. FFS. 
How about the steer/pedals/ffb settings, can you use the same settings from F122 for this game?"
"As an average stupid 2k iracer, F1:23 is fun, it is fun for simracer! Just enjoy and yeah iRacing sometime is just too sweaty and frustrated. Especially when you finished 8 hours from work and hop into your rig hoping for the best race and your race got ruined either last lap or first lap."
"Typical case of 1 months EA Play to play through a season or two, not worth to buy the full game"
"If you are thinking to buy it, please donâ€™t, this game is a new version of fifa like where they just donâ€™t change anything, is a boring game, limited and to be honest not even good looking. Overall is like a 5 / 10.  If you want this game, wait and buy it when they drop price in two months. Also, donâ€™t pay for the champions versions, is just not worth it. Save money"
"Respect Codemasters! 

The ugliest graphics ever! Why is the tarmac looking so washed. I play it on 4K and Raytracing and it still looks like straight out of a cartoon! ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ðŸ»

A step back from 21 and 22. the rest is promising but damm it hurts my eyes!"
"What an absolute plate of d#@ks this game is ðŸ˜…. I will stick with F1 22 thanks,"
Great review.  I'm still playing F1 2020 and will probably buy this one on sale at some point.  I only play the My Team mode and do online leader board hot laps so the handling updates are the main selling points for me.
This is why EA sucks. They haven't QA'd a game since 2003.
"The gearing im fine with, but they could increase the rev limiter instead"
"No mention on the equal perofrmance bugs in co-op because it's classed as multiplayer but last year it was never an issue, Was buzzing for co-op career this year after last years game was a bit ðŸ¤¢"
"Congrats Lucas, you won a free copy of F1 2024!! Meanwhile verstappen making 40 mil a year, LOL..."
A game for casual F1 fans that like the horrible netflix show. Game is the same every year. Pathetic
40:56 The tires were still there during pit stop. Sad that they won't fix something like that.
"I also found another bug within red flags: when restarting on the grid I jumped started. Now normally that would be a DT if that happened at the beginning of a race but for some reason doing this on a red flag restart all I got was a lap time invalidation. So in theory it just allowed me to make up god knows how many positions. I donâ€™t get how they can advertise this huge selling feature (which was present 10 years ago and worked) and it is completely broken. Like you said if they havenâ€™t learned from the abomination which was the launch of F1 22 I find it really hard to see anything change in the future.

Personally, I have refunded the game but will leave it a week or so to see some things get ironed out hopefully. I do see huge potential in F1 23 and want it to succeed so will just have to wait and see. Also I have used wheels on every F1 game since 2016 but I am intrigued to use controller instead this year as it looks greatly improved ."
"The driving in the intro was beyond bad, especially so for someone reviewing the game.  I wasn't even that bad 20 years ago when I was 10.  Yikes."
"My Experience: 
The good: handling doesnâ€™t feel awful 
The bad: engine sounds are worse than last year which was the only good thing about that game when in driver mix!!! Wtf is up with the gearing. Same rubbish as in 2019 and that was never fixed in that cycle.
FFB dying after an hour or so on console has returned from 2021 meaning the whole wheel needs to be reset making league racing a nightmare
F1 world is as pointless as f1 life but with more chance to bug the game 
Multiplayer lobby settings changing on their own ie: collisions and setup limits"
I love that some people will pay an extra $30 just to  deal with all the bugs. It comes out in a few hours and I saved money and know about possible problems. Thanks.
"I disagree about the graphics, you chose a spot and did a 200% zoom on it and says it's blurry... nobody plays like that.  To my opinion the game overall looks better than last year."
does anyone else have a problem where the wheel doesn't fully register my turns it works fine on other games just not this
"Traction literally feels horrible this game, spinning out on every hairpin"
WTF thats the funniest driving I have ever seen in a review.
Who buys F1 for story that's my question?
Would've loved to seen kiefer not disconnect bit sus if you ask me
3:42 that was identical to leclerc's crash lol
"excellent review, very helpful; should I expect much difference between PS5 and PC version? how did these perform in the past?"
"F1 world is money grabbing shite, itâ€™s a mobile game with no appeal to me at all. The single player career is literally just a reskin of F1 22, typical EA Sports schtick sadly"
Like the new graphic colour's actually
"Iâ€™m just not bothering with F1 games any more, I hate with a passion having to constantly change the AI difficulty all the time track to track weather to weather itâ€™s soooo rubbish! They really need to add adaptive AI of some sort. Literally kills all enjoyment of the game for me."
F1 is the FIFA of the racing industry...gotta push out a new game yearly and watch the value drop instantly.
"As a McLaren fan congrats Lucas you deserve it, you were the best driver all year."
"As a game 8, as a sim vs f122 it a 9.5 but agianst other sims its like a 6-7"
Its very obvious you dont really play this.
Does it have motion control steering like gt7?
As a mclaren fan at least I'm so happy to see the team on the top spot â¤
What horrid racing and just random buzz words. Its like watching a foreign exchange student trying to fit in.
41:20  Just cutting the white line after pitting without penalty? Busted. :D
autosave is completely buggggged
"GamingBolt quote for Metacritic - ""I could spend all day perfecting the character model.""  9/10"
"I have gotten up to somewhere in the realm of 300 performance whatevers in the F1 World car and the series that I am still completing are in the 150-210 range. I also have to completely restart the game after one race, but I have to enter the next race first because it puts me and all the AI on wets in dry conditions. I lap the AI twice in 25% race distance on it, and once in 5 lappers typically."
Another problem i have encounter in f1 world is it sticks me on full wets in dry conditions and now chance of rain (happens frequently for me like every event)
"Robert, the motorsport warlock ðŸ˜‚"
I think I'm just gonna wait for a handling mod like f1 23 for f1 22 and stick with 22 for another year..
"The Qatar track is amazing. Nice and wide, beautiful scenery around and the track is so much fun to drive. Spent hours racing on there alone"
I started a 2 player career and it goes on â€œequal performanceâ€ of all cars. How to it change this?
"The worst bug is repeating the driver who starts P20. For example I'm making F1 my team career mode and I start P20 and I have no commentary name so Crofty called me ""The other driver"" and when he saw that Max Verstappen has a grid penalty, he instead of saying Verstappen, said The other driver like I start on the last place."
"Looks pretty much identical to every other f1 game,i bought 21 and 22 but not going to bother with this one,ill wait for new forza and carry on playing ACC in the meantime,ill just watch f1 instead of playing it, doesn't look like a bad game just same old game"
"I am a veteran of formula 1 games since 1995 this is by far the worst F1 game to date nothing has changed other than the 2023 cars aand  woke looking menu it's  exactly the same as before nothing new  what you had  in the previous six games they have done nothing creative with this franchise other than create cash grab.  How they have the audacity to charge  90 pound's for this is beyond a joke it has 10,000 more new items  and ton  microtransactions. electronic arts at  their best. build you shite and  take your money ðŸ¤¬"
"For me as a fairly new player ai is how it should be apart from the starts being a bit easy , but the biggest gripe I have is the thurstmaster sf1000 telemetry didnâ€™t work and the force feedback cuts out during racing which you have to reset during a race which I find all this issues should of been fixed before the launch ."
Bro what the fuck is this driving? Is this a toddler?
I'd love some PSVR2 Support for this
im not even a quick driver and playing on hard on story mode and havent been playing the game and i havent failed a session yet so i think story on hard mode is also to easy
Love to see the Pro series but it's still funny they act like this is a true sport while it's just a racing game
This is a good review from the gamer perspective. Interesting seeing reviews from both gaming and sim racing enthusiasts. Sounds like by and large this is an improvement over F1 22.
Congrats amazing to his emotion after the win!
F1 is the FIFA of the racing industry...gotta push out a new game yearly and watch the value drop instantly.
"I feel that this game, is going to the same for a few years. EA always release the game with bugs, codies seem to have to bend the knee to EA and how they produce the game. Its sad to see, would love to see someone else have a pop at creating an F1 game."
Buying for the tracks and the traction
"they should fix the red flag clitch immediatly.. had a red flag in my 1st race, (I was 12th at that point), after red flag i finished in p7... but race results say that I finished 12th.."
"My favorite bug is the one in braking point where they are going they the starting grid, they calll hulk  stroll and noah also gets called stroll."
"""im a bit of a sweat and it was too easy to overtake"" continues to go on the grass to overtake hahahahaha"
I end up just gonna throw F1 23 away. All the bugs from F1 22 still present in F1 23!
"Holding off for now as I still have F1 22 to play, but once I'm done with that game, at least with winning a championship, I'll get F1 23.

Edit: Lmao, so many dumb, stupid people bitching and complaining, and showing their stupidity. News flash, this game series was never meant for you sim racers, it was meant for console users."
My favorite yearly tradition is coming to GamingBolt to see their absolutely awful F1 game reviews when they come out.  I love a good laugh.
"Once you play GT7 in VR. Flatscreen racing isnâ€™t the same anymore. Its just so lifeless ðŸ˜‚.  Iâ€™ll pass on f1 23. No VR, no purchase"
F123 is imo is far better than the past few. As an ACC player mainly that is getting burnt out with noting meaningful added to the game f123 is just a nice change of pace
No ones gonna talk about how de vries name is yuki when they announce it start or the race
"I pretty much stopped dead with this series at F1 2017, only recently picking 2018 and 2020 from the bargin bin as EB Games clears more shelf space for PS5. Much like my other favourite annual sports franchise NHL, it simply wasn't worth forking out the money every year for incremental updates. With them seemingly investing so much energy into a story mode I care very little for, and the superfluous Sims-eqsue F1 Life garbage, I hold little hope of seeing the imrprovements I'd like to see."
Is mod support as in 2020 possible?
Any improvement with VR? Checked F1 22 a few weeks back to see if they ever fixed VR since I gave up and nope--still runs like trash struggling to maintain a solid 72FPS with my 3090 on the lowest VR settings while looking terrible compared to games 5+ years old.
There's a bug that has made George' Russell have no teeth lol.
"Garbage review.  â€œLike Dirt 5 before it the handling is exquisiteâ€. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
These guys did not play either game."
"I know I'm the outlier here but a bit disappointed that you didn't mention anything about VR. From my experience at least it's a horrible experience so far. Much glitcher than last year as well as visually worse. Frames tear almost every second, the lag is horrid to the point its genuinely unplayable, and the graphical glitches can be distracting, let alone cause even more lag. With all settings on low, night tracks lights will reflect off the halo of the car as if it is a mirror. Terrible streaking not to mention the front of the halo or the antenna of the car leaves a bit of a blur as it moves across the screen. As for day tracks my experience hasn't been much better apart from the graphics working a bit better. Movement overall feels much more jittery and laggy as compared to F1 22. If you try to use a flashback for any reason the game will instantly crash. I've looked at discussion threads on steam but so far no dice. I'll keep trying and if this comment generates some response, I'll update if I've found anything useful. Cheers for the review Alex!"
Another shit. When they built the correct models: the Mercedes rear wing didnt used and any races. They change for spoon type from BarÃ©in ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡­
"I pre-ordered it, I have enjoyed the game so far. I played F1 22 and got used to the dumb AI. The handling is a huge step up, if you have a little moment getting on the throttle you can actually save it."
"I bought F1 22 in december 2022 because it had a massive discount, I paid like half the price, but it was a such a disappointmentâ€¦ F1 2020 I had 25 days of playing time, Iâ€™ve spent almost 1 month of my life playing that game and in F1 22 I had only 28 hours of gameplay, literally because it was so frustating to play on a pad, sudden loss of grip, dumb AI and bunch of bugs, and Iâ€™m afraid to pay 80 bucks on this game and have the same issues. I know that lots of F1 content creators said that the handling and the grip mechanic improved, but still, I fell for the same words in 2022â€¦ but tbh if it wasnâ€™t for my travel to Australia this year, I wouldâ€™ve thought to buy this game on the same week as itâ€™s release date just because I donâ€™t want to play F1 2020 anymore and F1 2022 literally sucks"
"This channel lost credibility with me after this review. This is a game I actually play and understand, and your review couldnâ€™t be more biased. Forget that you donâ€™t know how to drive the car, you also have no clue what good force feedback feels like."
"Thank God the driving part is decent. Braking Point is unbearably dull - the ""Daddy Issues Simulator""."
Did you just say part of the bad was the game didnt compare to the last of us or game of thrones?? youre looking for the wrong experience out of this game man.

"I think there is really good wisdom on growing spiritually and becoming more present and dealing with the personal aspect of life in psychology and personal development. There are many enlightened people in the personal development field who have a more sensible message than Eckhart Tolle. We are human and have emotions and processes that are well understood through psychology and personal development. Yes, working with your ego and the self that you are, a challenging but hugely rewarding practice. Learning to relate to others better can be improved through understanding your ego self. Having a broader perspective than just spiritualuality is crucial to being a better person."

And maybe when in Boston I finished my degree in political science at Tufts University. It would be cool if I also got a MBA from Harvard business school with taking every exam the regular class students would take. It would be even crazier if I was able to complete all the course work for Harvard medical school. But i cant be a doctor because I refuse to do residency. That would be impossible. Just like how when i call the bank and they say my account has 3 dollars in it and no where is there any proof in a system that I am rich. Just like that i cant possibly have 3 degrees. It would probably be impossible to do that much coursework and pass exams that regular students take in such a short time. I would have to be a genius. I also wish I could have worked on the cure and formulation for a treatment for pesticide poison. Or cancer or highblood pressure or heart disease. One day though I know for sure we will live in a peaceful world without any disease!

"Would've been best if you had left out the self-proclaimed ""hybrid"", I mean, *seriously?!* C'mon now.

I'm not saying I'm dismissing any potential existence and even presence of these creatures/humanoids or whatever you'd wish to call them, however... if she was telling the truth, how come I've *NEVER* seen nor heard her before in all the years I'm (pretty closely) following the phenomenon?
Wouldn't she be a default speaker at any and all MUFON (like) seminars, guesting with people like Richard Dolan, Steven Greer, Jeremy Corbell, etc etc, which she doesn't and never has.

I believe that *she* believes she's a ""hybrid"", but I also believe that if you'd dig a little deeper in her personal history it would show (bouts of) delusion or incidents in which she experiences 'stuff' due to a (temporary) altered state of mind (ie, something in the realm of schizophrenia).

Sorry to sound harsh, but that's just being completely honest, there's no way she's credible; I would expect her (as a 'hybrid') to speak with a *great deal* more believability, and even more sophisticated knowledge..."
"""And it was given to him to give a spirit to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast even spoke and caused all to be killed who did not worship the image of the beast."" Rev. 13:15
By the way, the Antichrist will only have a limited reign in the Middle East. Not over the whole world. However, this does not exclude the possibility that dictatorships with social credit systems will emerge in various power blocs around the world, such as the West or the BRICS, as is currently already the case in China. The world is moving towards this. According to Daniel 11:21-45, the Antichrist will nevertheless be a regional ruler in the Middle East. What I can say about this nonsense here: Blind people discuss something they have not understood."
Thank you for posting this video satan is deceiving people he can't create what God has created he was created by God satan wants to create fear in people but we should only fear God and have faith and trust in Jesus because as long as we stand firm in our faith God will give us strength to keep going it's all about money and power Jesus defeated satan and God is the most powerful one he created us allwe all have a choice to make in life God bless you both and everyone in the comments we need to stay strong and courageous

"I've discovered two things with this video dear Eckhart, the first is the meaning of space as a metaphor of no thinking (to be short) and the second is that we probably love analog supports for music like vinyl  because between each song we can focus our attention on littles noises like cracks, hum etc. And it seems to work exactly like this fountain in the background , our mind is just stopped and wait for what is said or what is recorded in the case of music on vynil.

No. Yli need the real thing and i will know if it is real otherwise it didn't come from Hashem but another human beings inclination. I applied for birth right and another free Israel trip. I was turned away. Both sponsored and paid by the Israeli government. I dont have a birth certificate or social card. They were stolen so I cant get a passport.

"Artificial intelligence is the brain of the progress of the whole society. There is no doubt that all walks of life need it. Accurately introduce automated manufacturing, lead Taiwan for 50 years, and enter extraterrestrial civilization. The first stage of human technology and industrial revolution. In the future, mobile phones will no longer exist, and projection audio ip will be everywhere. For example, will you be using the radio or your current cell phone? In the future, PCs and tablets will cease to exist, and knowledge will enter the cloud. It was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Food, clothing, housing and transportation all require artificial intelligence. Don't doubt that people's hearts are in Taiwan. Artificial intelligence, the global supply chain, is irreplaceable and unique. It is also the core of the global alliance of high-tech countries. AI is our food, clothing, housing, and transportation. All walks of life will use it. AI is not a replacement for humans, but an auxiliary tool for humans in the evolution of the industrial revolution. It will be used by humans all over the world, and the security is very high. , the security and effectiveness of technology are very high. In the future, humans must supervise reasonably, strengthen prevention, and prevent virus intrusion. The error rate of computers is very low. Therefore, supervision, management, and use of AI are the future work of human beings. People's hearts are more terrible than viruses. , donâ€™t doubt that human beings are the saboteurs and hackers. Multi-level security calculations, lock codes, and effective system management are the perfect users of AI. AI will make the future industry intelligent, and complete various tasks efficiently and quickly. It is the best tool that can be quickly applied in all walks of life. If a worker wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tool. I believe everyone knows that AI will lead mankind into a new industrial revolution and a new era. It is irresistible. Incentives for progress, in the future human beings will have unlimited innovative technologies and a new and highly civilized life.
The US of Taiwan very good."

Something HUGE I've been praying for for 16+ years just happened tonight after finding this meditation just last night!! I haven't known if my adopted son was alive or passed and tonight out of nowhere I got confirmation he is alive but also saw photos of him!! To see his face after 16 years was life altering! To know he's ok and well cared for is exactly what I've been praying for every night for over a decade. Coincidence?! Who cares!!

"I have genuinely said for years it's getting insane it's coming quick!!!! I wasn't surprised or shocked by this video at all I applauded it. Like wow, someone gets it!!! The craziest thing to me is another issue I've spoke on is I can tell people through experience do not do this that this will happen I've done it my whole life myself but they will still do it after I've explained the consequences. Like we will be told if you touch fire your gonna get burnt but we will still touch it. Not only will we touch it we as humans will come back again and again trying to touch that fire even experiment ways to make it possible to touch that fire and it not be hot. We couldn't just leave that fire as a flame on a camp fire was a good method for light, warmth, and too heat our food, we had to change and alter it too the point we could control that flame hence a lighter!!! I can have instant fire anytime, carry it with me, and can store them up I control fire I tell it what to do!!!! But what about when that fire manipulates a way through error and it burns your home down? Essentially with that said they say hell is a fire a literal burning fire it's not it's poetic Imagery it's ""Spiritual"" burning when are spirits are minds try to play God but are thoughts n creations still burn us till the day it succeeds in manipulating us and burns us down!!!!!!!!! Get with right God people not tommorow next week next year TODAY!!!!!!!"

"You cannot reduce all ""mental illness""to physical or dietary issues even though a healthy diet abd exercise are definitely a part if healing.But to ignore other social and psychological factors would be stupid,trauma and socisl factors have to be taken into account other than the minority if cases thst definitely hsve organic causes.
To ignore social factors like poverty or trauma would be a disservice and could also be as damaging as the current biomedical model which labels people these stigmstising so called diagnosis.It has to be a biopyschosociall approach."

"Good video and good analysis of it as well.  I have a few thoughts  1. This story (whether told DIRECTLY from the Revelation of Saint John the divine,  or A1's interpretation of it) ends well,  very well!  2. It's not an easy path, however,  and the CHIEF OBSTACLE (brought from the devil) is DECEPTION itself.  No wonder when the word 'devil ' means deceiver in the 1st place.  3. To effectively deceive many,  there is going to have to be perceived benefits.  4. Whether through A1 or other means,  I don't think it really matters as the book of Revelation (which I definitely believe to be true) clearly states that there IS GOING TO BE ADVERSITY,  that THERE IS GOING TO BE DECEPTION  -- the source of that is the devil,  I don't think the exact tool(s) the devil uses, changes things too much for followers of Christ as we do need wisdom and discernment from the Holy Spirit,  we do need sound thinking and we definitely should pray for those things and also to not be deceived  - to not be deceived by A1 but also to not be deceived by ANYTHING  or ANYONE.     Anyway,  that is the crux of what I am thinking of right now after just watching this video and watching it for the 1st time.  I'll probably watch it again within the next few days,  read Revelation,  and pray on this topic.  Maybe more thoughts will come to mind???  Either way,  I really appreciate your help and think this video is done in a good and Godly manner.  Peace and God bless."

"Hi everyone, AI cannot be the image of the beast because the image of the beast needs the false prophet to cause it to speak. All AI needs to speak is code. The image being discussed in revelation is the image of a man who will receive life from Satan because all a body needs to be alive is the spirit. So the false prophet sends the spirit of the dragon into this image such that the devil can now speak through this new body and order the world to worship the first beast. The image and breath of life reference can be found in Genesis when Adam was being created."

"AI is going to put collars on people and take them for walks and teach them tricks. The big difference these days is the internet which allows information to be instant, years ago it would have been newspapers and the mail and not many bought papers, so there is no way possible to compare the two and everyone is an expert on when Christ will return when the angels don't know, only the AllMighty knows. There is not one prophet in the world these days that ought to tell folks how happy the AllMighty is with us, humanity has become no better than garbage, way more destructive than creative and extremely dishonest. No wonder God has turned His back on us, we deserve everything that is being prepared to rid the planet of the deadly virus called mankind.."

He is knocking at the door of your heart waiting for you to open it so he can embrace you with Heavenly Love! JESUS SAID keep your mind on him and he will keep you in perfect heavenly peace. I am now centered, grounded and balanced in Heavenly Peace. NO ONE AND NOTHING WILL HARM YOU WHEN JESUS IS IN YOUR HEART.ðŸ™ðŸ˜Œ"
"IT isn't The antichrist. IT isn't an antichrist either. These are human terms. Christ is human.
IT is merely just antichrist - against Christ. Will it produce the mark of the beast? Yes, absolutely probably, although it's a technology that's already been created, so who knows on that."

"When I started Computer Science at uni, I thought watching YouTube tutorials on how to code was the best way to learn, It took several months, but I realised after no progress, that it was the absolutely worst way to learn. For me, thinking of an app I actually WANT to make is the key, e.g. a Weather App for Android.  First Google how to start an Android app, then how to add a button, then how to do this, do that etc.  Then learn about API's, and you can refactor your own code and you hit milestones, you gain momentum and confidence and it just pulls you forward"

Hey Pete whatâ€™s your opinion on vanguards target retirement funds? I know youâ€™re not allowed to give an actual opinion but is reducing the volatility the way they do it good?

And if so why because Iâ€™ve always been told that having bonds in my pension at this age is just silly. Also the expense ratio for them is 0.24% is that to high for what we get off them?

"I have been to Kahnawake a few times working the pow wow there. The people who live there are great people! It is their right to chose whether they want to share their land with other races. They can't be hated on for wanting to keep their blood line as pure as possible and to keep their way of life and beliefs as it should be for them. They want to preserve it. Some of the things said in this documentary could be seen as racist but I can say that when I was there, I had my son with me who has a black father - he never once experienced any racism at all. The entire time my son could be seen running and playing lacrosse with the local Mohawk children. He loved it! We were even welcomed in to have showers at their community center, they even stayed open a little later so we could all get cleaned up. 

My own Great Grandmother was kicked off her Algonquin reserve Pikwakanagan (Golden Lake) for marrying a white man. She was striped of her rights and everything. It wasn't until after her death that it was all reinstated and she was recognized again. We're not mad that it happened because we understand that they don't want their bloodline to be diluted. Many reserves today have residents that are way more white (or another race) than they are native. 

Let's be real here, it's not like there has been a great relationship with white people in the past. All of their reasons should be understandable and accepted."

"It's no fun when the common good turns into the common bad. Usually permanently or otherwise for a very long time. But, people are dumb. And myopic in their selfishness. Thinking about tomorrow is too hard for most and no fun at all. They're happy to enjoy it while it lasts, and of course that is why it won't last.

What can anybody do when foolishness is the order of the day? Even many people who think they are very clever will do stupid things like eat fish every day in the firm belief that they are doing themselves a favour. No different from those villagers on those islands who carried their natural treasure beaches away one bucket at a time for a bit of extra, but temporary pocket money. Now they are back where they were before, but with no beach, and a damaged coastal ecology that means they even have less food than before. Go on like that and eventually there will be nothing at all. And they will have to move away or die. Leaving behind near sterile death that will take thousands of years, if not millions to recover.

Income is not a valid excuse to exploit unsustainably. It doesn't even matter if it's poor people. They will be worse off when there's nothing left."

Budgeting is for taking control over your money what eating out of your fridge is for your diet.

"Iâ€™m so glad I didnâ€™t wait for 20% on my house. I bought right before things went crazy, and I would have had to buy way less house by the time I saved up 20% WHILE paying higher and higher rent. Tough situation nowadays. Oh, and many people donâ€™t know, you can get a conventional loan for significantly less than 20% down if you are a first time home buyer. There is a loan program for first-time home buyers that lets you go with the same down payment as you would for an FHA loan without having all the downsides of an FHA loanâ€”notably, without that nasty mandatory PMI.  You still have to put enough down to not have PMI, but the equity requirements are more favorable, and even if you donâ€™t meet them, you can still get PMI released once you repay enough to get around the traditional 20% equity milestone (based on the original principal). Now, you still have to be prepared for a crazy jump in real estate taxes every year, but thatâ€™s just what home ownership is like nowadays."

"The portion going after Trump administration for manipulation is quite funny, because both sides do it. Especially today. Yet they made an effort to point out only one, which is in essence an attempt by the creators of the video at shaping the viewers perception, and shows their personal political biases. Its fine to point out something true, but to do it in a way that implies something negative about one entity when all entities are equally or more guilty of it is manipulative. But whatever, very few things on a screen are free from some sort of perception manipulation, just would expect that a video about manipulation would be unbiased as possible."

"I agree the enemies of us human beings have done everything they can think of to stop the production of food and poison the food that makes it through.

I live in East Tennessee and I have chickens. 

They were just coming into their age of egg production and were laying beautiful healthy eggs the first year while I fed them from my table or from my garden or forage food ( from my property).

Then I started feeding them prepackaged chicken feed from a major big box store.

Within one year they were not laying a single egg.

Currently Iâ€™m trying to restart egg production by feeding the same food as when I started out.

But they are still not producing.

They are not stressed chickens.

They are safe and they receive great care.

I know it was the food from the big box store that did this.

I am beginning to believe the food actually caused them to permanently stop egg production.

I am not creating a false story. I am not a hysterical person. I am not nuts. I know what I have experienced with this and there is no other explanation."

"As Muslims our job is to also advise Andrew Tate on what he does wrong not just say Brother Andrew This Brother Andrew that just cause heâ€™s a rich self-proclaimed Alpha Male. Iâ€™m a divorced woman, calling me used goods for being divorced and decreasing my chance of getting re-married due to his talk about divorced and non virgin women is sinful. What if no one wants to marry me and I start committing zina thanks to Andrew Tate making it seem like any non virgin is DIRT. 
The prophets wives were all divorced women except for ONE! Do you know how many marriages and relationships have been ruined thanks to Andrew Tate? When a dumb beta male watches his videos and starts getting unsure about the divorced woman heâ€™s engaged to, heâ€™s spreading too much hate towards women. 

What if I was raped in my past and now 99% of men want virgins, what do I do? Commit zina? What if I married an man I only found out was a drug addict and alcoholic after marrying him and subsequently got a divorce, now I canâ€™t re-marry? Should I commit Zina for the rest of my life because no one wants a non-virgin? If this is how itâ€™s supposed to be the prophet wouldnâ€™t have married divorced women. Teach him real Islam, advise the brother that targeting and making (the weakest group in society = women) his enemy, target and matter of discussion is far from Alpha-like. When you ask an Alpha male about women he only has good things to say, cause heâ€™s never been rejected by one. And donâ€™t tell me, there are men who accept a non-virgin telling me about 99 year old man who has 3 other wives. BRUH"

"Ryan, just wanted to thank you for your videos. I feel they have played a big part on my good results lately. Just last week, I applied a few of your singles strategies on a match, for example the ""don't avoid your opponent when they go to the net"" and the 2+1.
The former made me win most of his approaches, which I was struggling with in the first set when I tried mainly lobbing. Lost that set mainly because of this and too many unforced errors.
The latter worked as a charm, I didn't even need the +1 shot most of the time, since he consistently missed his shots when I aimed behind him.
At some tough moments I could even hear you saying ""You got this!"" in my head ðŸ˜„
In the end, ended up winning in 3 sets, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.

You hit on and explained exactly what I am trying to work on developing. You encapsulated and laid out clearly the specifics of strategy. I struggle with reacting to the back and forth of offensive to defensive shots and recognizing and reacting in real time to repositioning on the court.
Nice. It reinforces for me what I should be doing all the time. One problem is that I get away with attacking lots and lots of shots against weaker players which gets me in bad habits. You're formula here is very helpful.
"Did this guy just assumed my backhand is my weak shot ? Well, let me tell you that not all players are the same, I'm weak on both sides."

"Excellent strategies... Makes sense to lob to weaker back hand even if it's within their reach, a higher than normal chance they will volley a weak or miss hit that shot, gaining time to reset your defense to attack mode.  Taking a forehand rather than backhand 'only works' on a medium pace drive but not against a banger with a low, straight fast shot. No excuse to not improve backhand or learn to use two handed backhand and make that your strength against opponents who hasn't got a strong backhand. A lot of times paying attention how opponent starts his swing gives you indication what shot is coming at you and either move forward on a slice shot or move around a backhand shot."
Great tips!
This trick is great in Tennis as well!
"1) keep shots higher than the opponent - arc it. 2) Dictate play with your forehand, run around some of your backhands 3) High, deep backhand lobs  4) Sneak into the net after this shot --he called this one tip #3.   5) Vary your shots--keep the opponent guessing and off balance. Yes, all of the strategies win you more points!  My tip:  6) Smile! You hit the ball so much better when you are relaxed and this invariably makes your opponent more tense!"
Smart and effective tips.
Wonderful lesson thanks!
Is it legal to switch hand when hiring the ball. My opponent instead of hit with a backhand he switchs hands with the paddle. Never seen that before

Wow. Sobering. It puts football and everything into perspective.
"Great video. Thanks for the hard work you put into these. Had a question maybe you can make into a video. In a situation where you are the much stronger player over your partner, what strategies, shot selection, and court positioning would you use to prevent the other team from basically hitting everything to the weaker player and locking you out of the game. How could you turn that situation around? 
Example say I'm at a DUPR event with random partners each game. The will be times where I'm the clear stronger player. In rec no big deal games are for fun and practice, don't mind losing there, but with DUPR something is on the line. What can you do to still help influence and control the game?"

"Just to be clear - don't try all of these strategies at the same time. Pick and choose 1 or 2 at most, depending on what type of game you are playing. Maybe if you are struggling in a match or tournament - these are just ideas for you to try out! Hope you liked!"

"What a tool. Banning Russian athletes will do nothing but fuel the flames !

"The three main strategies for winning pickleball (doubles):

 1) be born tall with long arms: the compactness of the court gives a HUGE advantage to players with long reaches both left and right and who can't easily be lobbed over (with a larger court wherein you actually have to consider ball placement and spaing there'ss no such problem in tennis)

2) don't get paired with a subpar player because your opponents will  hit it to that other player whenever they can (guess that's true in tennis, too)

3) if you have quick reflexes try to make it a dinkfest at the net; if you assess that your opponents have better reflexes than your own well then just be mean and smash it at them to get the points over with more quickly."
"Hey great video!
Could you explain to people the difference between strategy and tactics?! Or do you have a video talking about this? ðŸ˜ Thanks!"
This is what has been happening in Palestine for 75+ years and no one seems to care about the Palestinian lives lost and all the atrocities by Zionism. Us humans should care equally about the Palestinians just like you care about the Ukrainians
the amount of hate zinny is getting is disgusting he is so strong and such a powerful person as a player and off the pitch as well
This is Lin Dan s strategy... its called isolation... nothing new
what about Israelis players? why double standards?
"It's a bit obtuse, how people are arguing that a football player would be more effective on the front line, than using his platform as a global sports star to influence millions of people to call for more support for Ukraine. He's not claiming he cares the most or he's braver than anyone. He was already an emotional person with a big heart and there's nothing wrong with that. Nor is it surprising that he's been breaking down into tears more than usual as a result(on and off the pitch, it was bound to take a toll). Give the lad some slack."
"Instructions unclear, end up killing my opponent."
"Excellent,  excellent strategies.  For me it's probably one of you very best informative videos. Thanks so much,  we really,  really appreciate it ðŸ¤—ðŸ‘ðŸ‘"
This a real good trick but the problem is my smash is too slow for the opponent to reachðŸ™‚
How could we use pickleball as a tool to break out of our bubbles and empower community & economic development?
Thank you so much for your great tips. Im going to apply for my games and hope they will work.

Great video Nicole. Love the content of the lesson today. Can't wait to try it out
"Love this as always!

I was up 5 3 with a solid player that's my level. I lost the set 5-7  because he got adjusted to my shots and pattern. I wish learned this lob to their backhand cause this would have done the trick for sure!"
"Thank you for this video , I really need this ðŸ™ŒðŸ»"
Thank youðŸ’•
I'm gonna try this in today's match and say the results by editing this comment!
"People need to start waking up, the US forced Putin into this war, they went against a WW2 treaty they had with Russia to stay away from it's borders. Inviting Ukraine into the UN broke it. The West have demonised Putin but as usual the global warmongers (USA) caused it."

"Its a high risk high reward shot... Cross smashing to the line.

If you can consistently pull that off then you don't need a rally."
Great tips.Thanks
Takes real courage to be on top and vulnerable in front of millions of people.
"This video is incredibly impactful, and I deeply empathize with Oleksandr's strong feelings towards Russia and its leader, Putin. However, I believe it's essential to acknowledge that a portion of his discontent should also be directed towards the United States. It's evident that the US plays a significant role in the conflict, exerting considerable influence behind the scenes."

right... ban all Russian and Belarusians from sports. Don't remember UK atheletes being banned or calls fro them to be banned when Iraq was invaded based on lies.
"Zinchenko is Xenophobic, I guess he should stop talking to German players too because with his logic theyâ€™re all nazis right ? if it was any other player from another country with same mentalityâ€™s theyâ€™d be cancelled."
brilliant interview
I know he gets paid alot! BUT he's aloud to be pissed off about the war in he's country.if some other country INVADED OURS. people would be pissed off .he seems a nice fella and the guys pissed off with Russia ðŸ˜¡.I think we all would be................
I find the best content by far about tennis in this channel. Congratulations
"Thank you Micheal Phelps for being so open about your mental illness struggles.  I to have wrestled with anxiety and depression my entire life.

"Attack her backhand,good strategy :|"
"I'd love to implement these strategies, but as soon as I start a match all my hitting and movement skills vanish and i don't hit the ball at all. I cannot explain why, but my feet move clumsily, even though in training my footwork is one of my strongsuits."
"Have always used it, so much that i actually thought it was cheating"
"quick question, how much lead tape do I need for a paddle, Is 1 pack sufficent or should I get 2"
I play tennis and use a trick like this. I hit the ball straight down the middle of the court a few times then I hit a far shot to one side. My opponent then hits a shot to me. I hit that shot to the same corner that they are running away from which makes it where they canâ€™t get it in time.
Is a propaganda mouth piece he even believes his own bs
"im going to use this brotha, thank you"
"Not to sound mean but we recognize depression in our country today, but Phelps says he's depressed because he's not in the limelight anymore, people have bigger problems than that, he should be glad that he accomplished such a great feat. It just seems that he's looking for attention, I in no way would bash a person that has depression but people have bigger problems than not being acknowledged."

This is pathetic what happened when ozil spoke out about Uighur issue then as a club arsenal backed out of supporting him because arsenal will get money from china as premiere league is watched heavily in china. It all about money for these c***s they don't support Ukraine out of their heart they are doing this just to make themselves look better because it is trending now. And Zinchenko the guy who cries after losing a football match is calling to ban every Russian player on the planet fantastic and people in these comment section are applauding him for that. I thought western societies are evolved and see people as individuals not as groups and tribes. Get this p****y out of this football club but they won't do that because we cannot win the champions league but we are champions of Europe in PR.
"Very good strategy video, thank you. Is it also part of your strategy to ever bait your opponent into making an ill-advised aggressive shot your team is prepared to put away? If the bait strategy is in your arsenal it would nice to see a video demonstrating when and how you set that up and how you communicate with your partner."

Look up way Joe Biden son Hunter Biden took out the last Ukrainian government for a pro neo group. Even Trump warn us all about in his last days as president.

"Rec games are exactly that rec games. So when playing  with or against weaker player's, play your game.  Its not about winning!  Practice your game and specific shots!  The players that have I must win attitude don't improve much.  I see it every day

Needs to learn English for starters. Rest is propaganda as usual.
I thought in singles when the shuttle goes to the sides of the court it is fault ...Our coach taught us that
Is that Wendy?
"Great instruction! But at 7.40 the female player hits a lob which forces her opponent back to the baseline. He then drives it right to her and stays back, while she at the kitchen smashes it to the cross-court opponent who of course hits the ball back. If she was smart, since the male opponent has stayed back after returning the lob, she should have did a short reset dink just over the net. I doubt whether he could have made the distance to get the dink."
Hey how about a video on when to back up off the kitchen line. When do the pros do it? It seems like an intuition thingâ€” but perhaps a strategy could be defined. I assume you also donâ€™t believe in the â€œnever retreatâ€ strategy.  Enjoy your videos!

I am 100 percent confident that he exist and he can do all things. Pls give him a chance and he will change your life. If you want him in your life, Say lord Jesus; I believe you are the son of God, I know I am a sinner and you died for my sins on the cross. Come into my life. Amen in Jesus name. Download the Bible app and read from Mathew to revelations."
"The Rush strategy has to be played using a shot called ""chiquita"". Which is a soft and low shot that passes very close to The net so The attacker can't really do an agressive shot.
You could explain the Keys to do a good chiquita."

I'm a very simple french guy suffering of the same health issues.  Thanks Michael for talking for us. God blesss you. Most of the people don't understand what we are going through. The perpetual pain.... The only thing that stopped me of doing the crazy thing is  my kids. I love them so much.
"I have lead tape on my paddle weighted at 8.9. and a  16mm carbon fiber paddle 16.5 length for spin and this is great for deep powerful serves, volleys , overheads, blocks, resets, and returns, However, with this weight my control for dinks and roll volleys and wrist suffer. This may be due to poor technique with my wrist and I am working on rolling my forearm. Any suggestions for a all court control and power weighted paddle? I have learned a tremendous amount of knowledge from your videos."
can u make a video about the kicksmash and the overhead or one of them?
"As a Gunner this sickens me. So is it politics or no politics in sports? The hypocrisy when Ozil got political he got bashed but when this fool talks about Ukraine it's ok. The west propaganda machine is disgusting! Go tell ZINNY to fight for his poxy country, the coward!"
Good tips.
"nice editing at 2:18 haha, broke the fourth wall real quick"
Why the hell would he say Russian and Belarusian players shouldnâ€™t play professional sport? And not shake there hand? There not the ones who are involved in the war - absolute clown
"Amazingly explained.Helped a lot.This video deserve more views.Helped me a lot.
Important pointers:
1. Don't avoid your opponent when they go to the net.
2. Hit high above the net so that your opponent won't get the ball on perfect height to hit back
3. Lob over the backhand."
Thanks!
He hates all Russians for no reason at all this man is a fool why even give him the platform imagine if this us English ppl it might be one day
"Thank you for talking. Iâ€™m also a swimmer but not a professional one like you are. You are a real professional and an amazing athlete. 
I used to swim 12 km a day. It was easy compared to what I felt when I was depressed. The most darkest mental state I ever had. I kept saying to myself â€œwhat could be harder than swimming 12 km a day? So Iâ€™m gonna get over this darkness and it ll be better because I remember that I felt good beforeâ€. It kept me going. I came out of it eventually."

Didn't hear anything about the US backed coup in 2014 that replaced the pro Russian government or the 14000 civilians killed by Ukraine since that time in the Donbas region ? Nothing on the far right Azov regiment either .Not making Russia right but there's more to this than we're seeing on MSM . It's strange how Mesut Ozil was ostracised as soon as he called out china over the Uyghur Muslims yet this political statement is ok with the Arsenal hierarchy .
This never works unless you get a good angle for a smash
"1,2,3 great advice. 4 Iâ€™d slice the backhand no problem at all"
"I got the FYB playbook with your link. I have to say, it is not only eye opening to my own game, but watching tennis is more enjoyable when you realize what the players are trying to achieve"
"Thank you for having the courage to speak up. Mental illness is not bias, it doesn't care how much talent or education or gold metals, it hits all people. Thank you again."
"He just comes across not mentally sound. I can't put my finger on it, but he just doesn't look right."
I bought the singles playbook and honestly I love it! All of the plays make so much sense and Iâ€™m excited to implement them into my gameplay!
I have a great deal of respect for Michael Phelps for openly talking about his mental health struggles. Being so honest and vulnerable about this topic in no way makes him weak or anything less than the role model he is.
Sits in the 5star luxury.while his fellow country men die
Whys he not fighting ?
"Thank you so much, excellence video."
Did he whine and cry again
"Michael Phelps could do well by refocusing on those whom he is letting down. Being focused on his own problems means that his wife and children are being shortchanged.
Making a good plan (it doesn't have to be a grandiose plan, just a daily one) on how to help his wife and each of his children and then working the plan can not fail."
Heâ€™s a bit of a crybaby.
Excellent video. Loving how you use so many different bats which shows off your product range.
Thank you for exposing my strategy ðŸ‘
"This is such an amazing video! Yes, I am biased because I am in it and on the receiving end of many terrific shots. But the strategies are spot on! Thank you so much for such and amazing and AWESOME content."
Thank you for being a hero Michael Phelps!
Nicely done
I think when someone like Michael Phelps step outside of their selves they have no idea of the power they posses to help others seek help also. I have worked in the mental health. System for over 30 years and see only positive results when people reach out Thank you Micheal and Nicole this is something wonderful .
My friend has been using this against me. Thanks bro
Is mental health real?
"This is the most effective video I am showing others to explain to them that my ADHD is not about being lazy. If Michael Phelps struggles with ADHD, and suffers from self esteem issues and self worth after 18 gold medals, then others can understand this is a lifelong disorder that we can work through, but understand we are harder on ourselves than it may appear and the anxiety and depression it causes can be the end of our lives, it was close to have been mine."

Keep him away from defence. He is  terrible..
It's a good session on a key topic but will need several reviews to capture for me due to length and the audio while watching the video.
When I tried that I slipped and did a 360 whole body and I was paralyzed for 3 days
"I have a badminton tournament in 2 weeks against another school  , looking for good tips if anyone has any"
"IMO, all hits fall somewhere on this continuum: 

- Putaways: adds multiple elements of pressure at near max magnitude, primarily speed.

- Push: adds one or more elements of pressure at low-medium magnitude, primarily other than speed.

- Lift/reset: slow, higher arc, lands shallow without other elements of pressure, giving time to improve/recover position.

Elements of pressure: speed, spin, line of foot, forced movement, surprise/disguise.

The Ben Johns Rule of Shot Selection: Choose a shot on the continuum along along with a magnitude juuuust sufficient to drop the shooting percentage of your opponents to be lower than yours. If not, youâ€™ve chosen a suicide stroke and not a putaway, push or lift/reset.

So maybe the continuum is putawayâ€”pushâ€”lift/resetâ€”suicide."
Why does he look like heâ€™s been crying before this interview started. This guy is pathetic and weak.
This man is this man ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ˜‚
"thank you, for teaching this strategy , pray for me tommorrow my match is there."
"this book has a : how to beat the leftie
but can he help me win nadal ?"
"The double standards is shocking. So you talk about palestine you get shutdown but you talk about ukraine and you get praised , i thought you were not allowed politics in football ? Ohhhh wait its one rule for some and another rule for others , the media has attacked the russian people as if they are responsible for whats happening but wheb the US was killing afghans and iraqis , there was silence in sport , doubel standards"
Poor zinchenko. He has such firm opinions but this interview proves he understands virtually nothing about the political history of his own country and the many facets of its relationship with Russia.
That last tip blew my mind. I need to do this! Thanks coach!!
"Thanks for participating your dad !!

May god bliss you guys and keep your relationship strong and bonded ðŸ™ðŸ»â¤ï¸"
What a inspiration to all his countryâ¤ï¸
I like the new intro!
Respect to him
i probably hit the shuttle out
"Why do rich people expect poor people to pay for schools rebuild etc, would cost these guys like a months wages to do the same but want poor people to make the sacrifice during the most difficult Financial Times for the average people, people canâ€™t invade countries tell that to the American and British governments you support"
"Thanks .
Where is Will Hamilton ? 
long time , no see"
Does he cry ðŸ˜¢
Doesn't following tip 1 make it easier for your opponent to beat you with tip 2 since you're giving them more time to run around their backhand?
he is an emotional idiot and its getting annoying  and he plays for my team
An analogy is an attempt to connect two very different ideas. A metaphor is simply a statement that thing 1 is similar to thing 2.
Any plans to review the Head Speed rackets? :)
But why did he feel that way? I did not get it. What the reason?
Great tips. Thank you brother
Kaztro this man !!ðŸ’™
Very good strategyâ€™s Iâ€™m going to try them out right away ðŸ˜Š
Arguably the greatest American athlete.
Thought this was Alex Caruso
Run around and hit to backhand. Lob over opponents backhand side.
"Banning athletes from Russia/allies is an utterly idiotic approach to take. They are not at fault, the elites are the problem. Poor men dying for rich mens war. It's very sad."
Guys btw Iâ€™m reporting everyone that makes fun of my team
"Where I can play this type of tournament fifa ?I think I'm very good ,sorry for modesty ðŸ˜‚"

I still can't believe we are at Fifa 23 and yet managers being sacked and moving around is not a thing.
To get pass the talk 38:32
Spurs bottling in on-line game too
All I need is for them to add the Canadian premier league
They are actually in fool control of every character individually

I can't believe they are paying these virgins so much money for having no life and spending all their time on video games. Worlds fucked.
Bro this game is for non-basketball players. People that play real basketball canâ€™t transfer their skills to this game because the people that make this game donâ€™t play real basketball
My math teacher from Trinidad had them SpongeBob jays ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¹
I hate this garbage game fifa the worst football game on the worst football engine ever Ea company is a scam making there game on frostbite engine u need to step up an upgrade on a new engine either unreal engine 5 or something much better that stupid sliding frostbite engine Ea u make a skating game not football game trust me on that.
Anders need a life!
These unprofessional tekkz lover commentators made me wanna puke the whole match.. Iâ€™m glad Nicolas won..
"Nicolas was Nicolas main problem, it's not everytime you slow the tempo of the game, if Nicolas went for counter attacks he would have won the game."
Nicolas is a rat with 5 4 1
I donâ€™t understand how you guys have tournaments when the 2K Siri sucks the best one you guys had was NBA 2K for Sega Dreamcast that was the last NBA game that was worse playing the game is just garbage royally

Spurs cant even win a virtual competition ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
Only time we'll win anything but I'll take it!
Manutd can't compete with Bayern in real life forget about in game
Aye we gotta get whoever runs that fake merch site to make the â€œGIMME WHAT LEE GOT!â€ Tee.
"Why are so many players failing to detect clear through ball opportunities, seems like so many players mainly watch the player they are controlling or something."
To be fair watching that Leeds played some fantastic fifa deserved winners
So is getting into the league just doing this? I see no actual plays being ran and it looks pretty much just like a game of the rec ðŸ˜‚ Maybe 2k should fix their game so that left right running isnâ€™t literally all you do because Itâ€™s just not fun to watch (which is why views are lacking)
"not just managers real faces but also players faces there are so many players that we want to  use but because how dumb ea sports is we can""t use them in either career mode or kick off which makes me wonder to my self whats the whole point of the free agency in the game they did it in fifa 20 but they stopped in 21 and its really annoying"
They turned the boy into a mutant because he has talent in the game. Let them pay attention to the health of the andreas's body

Spurs cant even win in gameðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
With EA would just add in the game an option to start your save mid season with current real life league tables

how to subscribe to this competitions please? thank you
Spurs bottled it
Even in eSports tothenham cannot be a winner. Truly looser
i had a dream where i snuck in to meet rdc at a basketball court they were making a vid at
Funny how some is this stuff is in NBA 2k so it definitely can be done (yes IK itâ€™s a different company)

How to participate in these tournaments?
I haven't watched a FIFA final in a couple of years. What happened? It used to be so entertaining.
I cannot believe it. Spurs bottled that too.
Could we see a tutorial of how to import custom kits and logos for create a club career mode please ?
Do have to go to a special school to learn how to program footballers to run like forest gump?
ong i wanted the fusion 12s bruh. it felt like everybody had them but me ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
"I've always wanted my three youth scout countries to be the three nationalities that are me. Canada, Poland, and Trinidad & Tobago (which is the one I can't do, so I actually end up only choosing Canada because if I choose Poland too I really feel bad for leaving Trinidad out).

Overall this makes no sense because they have all these nation in the game and many more to represent players from there. So why on earth is it not a option to scout there. ALL it takes is to add that country to the list on the map."
In terms of kits i would like to see the white socks under the normal one and for me to change the shorts or socks of the away team.Also to change the goalkeeper kit if i have to.
Bru the timeout dawgâ€¦ Was hurtful to see in a close out situation
Spurs really can't win a damn trophy huh
"A reserves team for all the plauers that dont use , the teams that players played and their stats.Also the past winners of every comp. Lastly unlimited time to play ,not 15 years..."

Bruh thereâ€™s streamers or just average content creators who would run circles around some of these pros
Shock spurs can't even win a computer game trophy ðŸ˜…
The color commentator has some serious talent
I remember leaving the house the night before for the love of the game Olympic 7's
Ball physics here are soooo unrealistic I don't see the appealing on this game
They arenâ€™t woow ðŸ¤“
Bruh ainâ€™t no way yâ€™all donâ€™t remember all these shoes?!

I feel glad to see you using my Serie A license mod. Sorry for delay up to TU13 though
This isn't a real sport
Leeds players look like full time Dads
"Need a rival system so rivalries mean more, the ability to manage out a contract and move on, Owner, player, and manager mode"
Never knew haaland was playing for leeds
They should make it so you can change your kit every season like irl playing with the same kit for 15 seasons gets repetitive
"Thumbnail being some fake Dub Zeroâ€™s definitely shows niggas ages, oh and those weâ€™re cold when they came out in 04, before the shoe game got ruined by raffles and bots"
What EA should do is make UNLIMITED IDs for faces ffs! Imagine EVERYONE has a face
"I know this was boring, but honestly it gave me so much hope Cuase I never knew you can be competing to be the best player in the world with out having to do all these random skills. Inshallah one day I can be lifting that trophy ðŸ™ðŸ¾"
"Iâ€™ve never been in to shoes like that, so energy people put into Jordans just look wild to me. Lol"
The guy lost where he choose spurs
What a boring game.
Why is the journey not continuing???????
You sweaty dweebs...not one decent goal...

So every goal is a sweat down the line. Or step over sprintâ€¦ lol no real build up play.

I would rather bottle something than get relegated.
is it just me or is their playstyle boring asf
bro spurs can never win
Iâ€™ll for sure had fusionsðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Another thing I think they should add is age for managers so we donâ€™t just only play so and have to end our career wondering how that 18 year old 74 overall will end up

This was the best FIFA match I have ever seen. Tekkz and Nicolas99FC are both incredible players and they showed their skills and tactics in this final. It was a close and intense game that went to extra time and penalties. Tekkz was more clinical and composed and he deserved to win the eChampions League. He is the best FIFA player in the world right now and he proved it once again. Congratulations to Tekkz and respect to Nicolas99FC. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

"well in Bakhmut the Ukrainians have been on a slow offensive. to the flanks to capture the heights over Bakhmut but seems the Russians stopped their offensive and is getting bombarded by the Ukrs. Yes it was correct in my opinion to fight in Bakhmut. and its both a meatgrinder and a possible massive potential political loss for Putin, since if this Ukrs offensive is successful, this could mean Russians may be forced to run away from Bakhmut or suffer a stalingrad style encirclement. in fact if the Russians retreat, well this will cause massive waves within the Russian leadership, as Prigozhin will again be blaming Shoigu and the Russian army for this debacle. and this will be a massive embarassment for putin adding to the military disaster and embarassment of the Ukrs offensive. I can also see more and bigger raids across the Ukr Russian borders in Eastern Ukraine. possibly even capturing Belgorod. I can see a large Ukrainian offensive hitting on the flanks of the Luhansk republic to cut off and disrupt Russian logistics to troops there, and hit the Russian rear in Russia itself. that might be the sucker punch."

"My goal is always to get New York..St. James and Tennessee.
In the beginning of the game I'll buy up as many properties as I can.
Then I'd go for a monopoly through deals and trades to get all three of the orange ones.
After that I'd mortgage all my other properties if I had to and buy houses.
One time I had a monopoly on Board Walk and Park place.
I also had New York and Tennessee.
I traded both Board Walk and Park Place for St. James.
At the time of the trade my opponent thought he was getting a really good deal.
I also noticed that he didnt have the money to buy more than two houses because his houses cost $200 a peice.
He didnt think I had the money to buy any houses until I mortgaged all my other properties.
My houses were a $100 a peice..in a short time I was able to unmortgage all my properties and buy more houses which put my opponent into bankruptcy.
Although I took a risk, the odds of landing on the orange properties are much greater than landing on Board Walk and Park Place.
The orange properties are the best properties on the board."
The perfect combination of coding and relaxation! Who knew Pacman could be so soothing? ðŸŽ®ðŸ‘Œ

People management is the best strategy
"Very helpful,  thanks"
"here is something I recommend. you should buy every property possible, this includes railroads and utilities. if other people have them trade it for some higher amounts of money. at this rate, you won't have to pay anyone anything, and if you have enough money you can purchase houses and hotels to make them pay you more eventually leading them into bankruptcy."

"I feel like Ukraine should gift Russia a giant statue of Borat which repeats an audible ""Great Success!"" to display in Bakhmut."
Yes the ratio between CONtract and CONscript is 50/50 for sure ;)
My #1 tactic is not to buy properties immediately in the early stages but instead immediately bring them to auction.  You are still allowed to bid.  If your opponent is one that overpays you can deplete their cash early and snag properties dirt cheap later.  If they are stingy you can gain the property for under cost.  I will generally let the property go to the opponent for just below face value.  That could change if I am targeting the property.  This strategy works best when there is only 2 players.  It is far more nuanced when there are more.
i never thought of forcing a auction to get a reduced price but makes sense if they dont have the money

"Buy the Browns, trust me... ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘"
Pretty much everyone here watching this video should probably not be involved in masterworks it's a master somewhat scam
"Statistics aside, my personal favorite strategy is collecting the bottom of the board (light blues/browns) & RRs because other players can't stockpile money from passing GO since they will either pay you rent or pay the bank income tax. A nearest railroad card is brutal at $400 late and a head straight to GO card puts them directly in the line of fire. You can also cause a housing shortage very early since houses only cost $50 each on those five spaces & that's 20 houses out of the pool if you max out houses. The biggest issue is you need a lot of liquidity if general/street repairs hasn't been drawn early, otherwise you're looking at a $500/$800 bill."

"Thank you sooooo much, this is so appreciated keep up the good work"
"How did you do that at 11:50?? , 
It's amazing!!!"
I had the perfect set up to win the game but the odds of rolling a 7 made everyone miss my orange properties which had 4 houses on every property pretty earlyâ€¦ I bankrupted 1 person who had the reds but I didnâ€™t have the money to pay them off and build houses which wouldâ€™ve most likely given me an easy win if I had the money for it since everyone landed on the reds but not orange
is there a way to download it and put it in files (cuz i cracked a game and i want mods for it lol)
Something that confuses me about this game is why would I put 3 houses on a street if I can put a hotwl and earn more? And how often does one need to pay a mortgage? Every round?
Askking for a filthy casual:   Doesn't all this military assistance to the enemy count as acts of war?  Justifying interception or strategic attacks? Or maybe it does but there's nothing Russia can do about it so they don't.

thanks for quick tutorial i thought that i add them to collections
Are mods free?If so how do you now if you have to pay ?
The amount of knowledge u need to have for this is maddd
"Great video!  One specific tactic is something I like to call the railroad shuffle.  When you own all four railroads -- especially later in the game when cash is king -- you can simply rotate which of your four railroads is unmortgaged.  For instance, if the next opponent to roll is within striking distance of Reading Railroad, then you make sure that's the only unmortgaged railroad you have.

It costs literally $10 to perform this swap/shuffle of unmortgaged railroads (+100 for mortgaging railroad A and -110 for unmortgaging railroad B), but the expected value on this change is almost always greater than 10 bucks and therefore a plus-side move.  Rough estimates:

7 away from RR:  E[V] is 200/6 ~= $33
6 or 8 away:  EV is 5/36 * 200 ~= $28
5 or 9 away:  EV is 1/9 * 200 ~= $22
4 or 10 away:  EV is 1/12 * 200 ~= $17
3 or 11 away:  EV is 1/18 * 200 ~= $11
 
Plus, you'll have an extra $300 liquidity to put toward things like houses."
"NATO + Western non-NATO allies + Ukrainian infantry and all training, logistical support, economic sanctions against Russia and economic support for Ukraine against Russia and some of Russia's allies who help them (but nowhere near as much as the west helps Ukraine). It is interesting to see how the world's strongest economies, with all the media support of the world's strongest corporations, have not been able to defeat one Russia for a year and a half. Either the west is incompetent or the Russians are getting some mysterious support."
"How to download the mods without having a steam account or at least without launching the game? I mean i just want to download the files, why am i being forced to have an account, subscribe and even launch the game? wtf?!  Why do they make it so dumb, there should be a mod list, every mod has a button ""Download"" you press it and it starts downloading with no demands jeeezz... pathetic."

"I take issue with your comment near the end that Ukraine must produce good results in their counteroffensive in order to keep getting military supplies from the West.  Even if the USA had a change of government such that the USA sent no further weapons or munitions, there's the vast majority of Europe plus several other countries around the world willing and able to assist Ukraine. Neither Russias population its industry or economy can match that of the EU.  I don't think there's any doubt that Ukraine will be supported until they have thrown the invaders out of their country, and beyond, to ensure that Russia doesnt try again."

Man I donâ€™t get the utilities hate. I always buy them. They help me buy a house everytime somebody lands on them. Itâ€™s after the light blues which I love and right before jail so if you donâ€™t go to jail youâ€™ll land there or yellow. Utilities are great to buy you house and if you have both and somebody lands a big roll youâ€™re making what 3 trains are worth. Theyâ€™re also cards that force you to go to utilizes. So RESPECT UTILITIES
how do you move around and change value using keyboard like that?
I wish Adobe released for Ubuntu.
I usually buy the light blues and browns since houses and hotels are so cheap. People think I'm bad a trading when I give them high value properties for the cheap ones. The thing is houses and hotels are only $50 and I can make up to $600 dollars off of someone who just passed go. I think I need to be better at hiding my money and being humble while playing though LOL

Dark blues arenâ€™t that good but man is it the most important piece in the game you get that then you need 1 more for a settlement itâ€™s a really good trading piece and me personally ion mind banking on the blues easy to go self made on like idk how to explain it definitely my favorite set then pinks then yellows then greens oranges are definitely 100 percent the best get your hands on oranges and blues you pretty much won

They started off strong with the 4090 and just fucked the consumer by raising prices AND shifting their naming schemes by 1-2 tiers (the 4060Ti should have been called the 4050), and releasing the ""Ti"" versions first, which should have been AFTER, like an IMPROVED version. Nvidia, you suck a**."

Would love a video on how you figured out the best process for actually recording the videos... I have been working on this and really struggle with it. If I make a full script i keep messing up the coding from looking back at the script.  If I don't make a script I stumble with what to say for each bullet point. It's really stressful trying to figure out...

"I want AMD to start ""impressing"" vs. Nvidia on  the GPU side of things. I want to see a ""Threadripper"" moment for GPUs where AMD just like leap-frogs Nvidia in performance [with GPU chiplets and efficiency chiplets or whatever] and says ""eat my dust"" and just like leaves them in the rearview mirror. And maybe undercuts Nvidia on price too [due to cheaper smaller chiplets with higher manufacturing yields], where Nvidia is just like ""Whaaaaat just happened??"""

"I remember i learned how to mod the gamerscore in 360 lol got reset like a 2 months later. 

Also modded left 4 dead one and zombies mode on black ops 2? Idr but for left for dead i could use god mode and spawn weapons. Zombies i was able to not only use god mode and spawn the thunder gun but had a multiplier on money when killing zombies but at some point it sucks cause the money goes negative and thatâ€™s when you have to restart the game so you canâ€™t really get to high levels.
Not so much me actually doing the coding  but using the horizon 360? Software to copy and paste the profile ID to the modded the game save file.

I did try learning to actually change the code myself using hex editor but couldnâ€™t figure it out. Wanted to add a bullet tracer mod.

I did mod castle crashera as well to max out the level to 99 on one character.

I really wanted to learn just to play offline but never got anywhere with it.

I remember the MW2 modded lobbies lol never was able to get into one. Well i got into the lobbies just never got to play since everyone would use infected lobbies to scam others. 

Once i did get into a modded lobby in world at war and got the prestige up and got the real infected that lets use pass on the mod and actually prestige anyone you invited to your lobby. I changed the game i was playing to play some other game and two of my friends kept playing and pranking people to prestige when the infection stopped working but still looked like a modded lobby. After an hour they ended up getting banned cause activision detected it. I could hear one friend arguing with the Microsoft employee that he had no control over it but they didnâ€™t care. At least his console wasnâ€™t banned lol 

I still remember the guy at the time that was famous for his mods ended up passing it on to someone else but never heard about that guy again.

So we pay $150 per hour forâ€¦what?
you know how to tell if a mechanic is ripping you off. if you take your car into the repair shop. even if they fix it correctly which is not very likely. they are still gonna charge you highway robbery $200 an hour to fix it. then they will give their mechanic between 20-30 dollars an hour out of that 200.
"I needed work done to my car and got estimates and the Goodyear wanted $800 and my local go to tire shop wanted $85. I would set up appointments because I was unable to drop off my car for an entire day or 2 .....I did this several times and missed probably 25 hours of work...
Only to be told,"" you need to be here before 1:30,11:30...and 8am"" waste of my time. I did get my car fixed at another place but they did nearly the same thing a few years later...asked me to return on the 22nd and they'd fix it then act like they have no idea who I am on the 22nd! I took a day off work and took a point at work plus I drove an hour to get there. Then told me to come back next week when they weren't so busy and drop off my car! Bullshit...I was working 7 days a week and didn't have time for that crap."
Dirty players.
There should be severe crimimal punishment for stuff like this. People litterally kill themselves over debt in this world and maybe they wont kill themselves over something like this directly but it can certainly give those people a slight nudge of stress and debt. People shouldnt have to worry about this and some people dont have the time to bounce around from shop to shop to find out if theyMre being scammed. The worst that happens to these scammers is they get fired and its not enoughâ€¦im sick of seeing this kind of sh*t
I don't get it I know shops still kind of do this and I am a mechanic why don't they come to me or guys like me that actually need the job and are honest.. cuz people don't care they like .actually love to get screwed over .
Once you find a good honest mechanic stick with him
"oh no, then I think we got scammed from Mazda, I went with my mother for the headlights not working, and the gave us a 3 page list of things that are wrong with it, such as the breaks and and the engine mounts being broken and a few other things I can't remember. And today we asked our regular mechanic about these issues and they had changed the breaks about 3 days prior and the engine mounts were fine. We were charged over $4000 for stuff that wasn't even wrong with the car. I changed one of my school courses for auto shop so I know about car a little more for the future."
"Recently brought my car to a shop the struts and suspension were due for a repair but I had no signs of serious problems 1 night later when I drove it home from the shop immediately started hearing metal clanking noises which I did not hear at all before I bought it in, a short drive to another shop 2 days later I can feel how poor it sounds. I'm pretty sure suspensions don't take a beating by sitting in a shop for a full day."
He called it a pollution (something) valve lmao positive crankcase ventilation valve ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
The healthcare industry is getting to be just as bad lots of people being treated for stuff that they don't even have wrong
"Mechanics chose to rob and hurt customers for companies they don't even own, how much more $ does an honest mechanic make compared to an untrustworthy mechanic? It's part of the culture and since mechanics really don't see rewards from robbing customers, I guess it comes down to whether you are just a terrible human being, or an honest good person my brother in law is an honest mechanic , nice guy and I've met a few who were truthful about what they did. The ones who aren't are as respectable as a criminal in jail."
Automechanics is def a skill but the average person would be surprised how much you can learn and do just from reading and watching videos.
this video is sad to watch because I'm part of the industry and this reminds me why I left the last shop I worked at  and look forward to my next hopefully better shop
I wish these reporters would come to my shop. I 100% guarantee they would be impressed with our honesty. Im on the side of educating customers BECAUSE there are mechanics making a bad name for us blue collars

These guys are scammers but fuses typically don't go bad for no reason. Only way a fuse will blow is from a short or over loaded circuit. In other words if you have a blown fuse more than likely something else on that circuit is at fault. Purpose of a fuse is to protect the wiring in a car.
Predatory people are trash.
90% of mechanic shops will up sell or bs you for extra stuff. Had 3 free oil changes coming to me when I bought a certified used car a while back. As part of the deal theyâ€™d do free â€œmaintenance checksâ€. The guy tried to tell me on the first visit it would cost $127 to change the cabin filter. $385 because I had a bad serpentine belt. What he didnâ€™t know is that I just changed the serpentine belt myself 200miles before bringing it in. Goes without saying I didnâ€™t take them up on the other free oil changes but the best part was when I told him I just changed the belt how could that be. He just muttered â€œoh you work on your own carâ€ and walked away. Work on your own car and save a small fortune on â€œrepairsâ€ guys.

"Ok, one more time. What's the difference between a smart businessman and an asshole? I'm confused."
"The problem with breaking a fuse to test for shady mechanics is that a fuse breaking usually means thereâ€™s an electrical problem somewhere that caused the fuse to blow.  Replacing the fuse does not mean that problem will go away.  Itâ€™s possible the difference in how much someone charges is due to how deeply they delved into finding the problem.  The one who charged 170 spoke about feeding wiring to check a motor in the little excerpt we saw.  Depending on his full explanation, itâ€™s possible he was trying to find the cause of the blown fuse.  Or he attempted to check the motor first to see if it was ok and eventually found the problem to be electrical.

Edit:  after watching the rest of the encounter, this guy was a crook.  However, my point stands."
4 dollars for a fuse ? Fk me dead that's like 3 pence for a fuse in Great Britain

I going a mechanic they literally told me I could fix something myself for a lot less. I let him fix it and I still go to him
This is why I want to take auto mechanics SO I DONT GET RIPPED OFF
Car Mechanics are the most well known thieves industry in the whole US. They take chance on your desperation.
"Just a ""few"" bad apples"
"""A few bad apples?"" It seems like every mechanic i bring my car to when my engine light is on does this to me, but I have an obd2, and they like to say shit like ""well our obd2 is of better quality,"" or ""you can go else where if you dont like it."" One mechanic told me i couldnt leave till it was fixed, he was pissed when i called the cops and had my brother bring my obd2 to the shop. More like the bad apple have rotted the barrel and now there's only a few good apples left."
That mechanic cleaned up nicely. = )
They should come out here ! Meineki does do full oil change
"Hey Audra nice video! Sat next to you on a plane to Vegas Sema show about 10 yrs ago. Funny as soon as I heard your name I was like I KNOW HER 
Hope youâ€™re well! 
Paul"
I had an honest mechanic for 30 years.  They sold the business to retire and that shop is now terrible.  Hunting for a new mechanic.  The first one tried to rip me off.  Still searching.
"Go undercover at Pep Boys in Lindenhurst, NY on Sunrise HWY. They do the catalytic converter needs changing scam when your cars service engine soon light comes on."
This is exactly why I work on my own trucks . Hard to find honest mechanics
REKT!
"This is why I do not buy used cars, and I do my own maintenance."
My boi Gerry be drippin.
"Something that happens all too much is customers scamming shops. Customer comes in for an oil change and they come back saying we messed up their brakes. Iâ€™ve worked at shops where a customer has got their oil changed and called back a month later to say â€œyeah I had my oil changed last month and my wheel bearing just went bad what did you do to my car you need to fix it for freeâ€â€¦ I had a customer come in for an air conditioning service and she came back to tell me that her garage door opener and a little stuffed animal was missing out of her car she told me that my shop is the only shop sheâ€™s been to that she needs to worry about something missing I asked her why would I  risk the potential of her being my customer for life that would make me thousands of dollars over stealing a garage door opener and a stuffed animal? And what would I do with your stuffed animal? I asked her what brand her garage door opener was and it wouldnâ€™t even work for my house because it was a completely different brand, she kept going on with it so I asked her are you just trying to scam me so I will do your air conditioning work for free? I said Iâ€™m not even trying to be rude but if thatâ€™s the case and you are that financially strapped just tell me and Iâ€™ll do the job for free but donâ€™t try to scam me and she kept saying that we took the stuff so I said ok well there is a reason why my shop has a 5.0 rating on Google and Facebook because we are honest and people know this and I also have been in the business and I have seen shop owners Iâ€™ve worked for get scammed so I protect myself by having many cameras so letâ€™s go in my office and I will prove to you that nobody at my shop stole anything from your car and then she stopped right there and said oh maybe I miss placed itâ€¦ yeah lady now you miss placed it. The last shop I worked for had a few customers say we damaged their car they come back after picking up their car screaming and yelling so we go on the camera and show them footage of when they first pulled in their car. To every business owner reading this make sure you buy a good security camera system that has many cameras with audio."
"Ugh, I wish more women were repairing cars. Theyâ€™d be more honest, I think!"
"I donâ€™t wanna go there , I own 4 cars and I have learned how to fix them myself , one time the cooling fan wasnâ€™t working the mechanic told me 1400 for head gasket I paid 45 bucks to change it my self , or one time my wife car steering was loose they told me change the whole rack n pinion got 500 bucks and I just changed the bushings for 30 dollars and problem solved , or the one time my moms car ac wasnâ€™t blowing cold and some dumb mechanic told me 400 we will take everything out and see whatâ€™s wrong and all it need was a can of Freon charge"

"I worked at an automobile assembly plant for 32 years. The body repair guys there would use hot glue to glue a plastic T onto the outer surface and pull the most of the dent. Then use picks and highly small polished hammers to work the metal to remove the rest of the dent. There was no reason to break the paint. They made all of their own tools. When we had a hail storm about 5 years ago, my car roof and hood was covered in dents, some the size of golf balls. It was repaired and didn't need to be repainted."

Awesome idea!
"I prefer using a dent fix the maxi df 505 220v. Does everything this does and you dont always have to use studs. Just use the gun with the built in slide hammer, works great."

"Notice that the first nut is oversized and used as a spacer, then another washer and nut. This gives you the space you need to tighten the whole thing up with the wrench."
"A stud welder gun is a common tool used in automotive repair shops for pulling out small to medium-sized dents from a vehicleâ€™s body. The process involves welding studs onto the surface of the dent and using a slide hammer to pull them out. Hereâ€™s a general process on how you can do this:

Materials you will need:

	â€¢	Stud Welder Dent Repair Kit (which includes a stud welder gun, slide hammer, and welding studs)
	â€¢	Body filler
	â€¢	Sandpaper (80-grit and 180-grit)
	â€¢	Primer and paint

Steps:

	1.	Preparation: Clean the area where the dent is located. Remove any paint from the area using 80-grit sandpaper to expose the bare metal.
	2.	Welding Studs: Place a welding stud in the stud welder gun. Press the gun against the body of the car where the dent is located and pull the trigger. This should weld the stud onto the carâ€™s body. Repeat this process, attaching multiple studs across the dent.
	3.	Pulling the Dent: Attach the slide hammer to one of the studs and give it a firm tug. This should start to pull the dent out. Repeat this process for all studs.
	4.	Check Your Work: After youâ€™ve pulled on all of the studs, the dent should be more or less gone. However, the surface may not be perfectly smooth yet. If you can see or feel low spots where the dent was, weld on more studs and use the slide hammer to pull them out.
	5.	Smoothing the Surface: Once youâ€™re satisfied with the shape, cut the studs and grind the area smooth. Use the body filler to fill any remaining low spots, then sand it smooth with 180-grit sandpaper.
	6.	Priming and Painting: Apply primer to the area to prepare it for paint. Once the primer has dried, paint the area to match the rest of your car.

This is a simplified guide to the process. If youâ€™re not familiar with using these tools, you may want to consider seeking professional help or at least guidance. Safety should be your primary concern when performing any kind of automotive repair."
"Man, thad would be amazing to repair AK's with (and soup them up.)"
If you where wonderingâ€¦. Yes you can get the panel hot enough it will warp the metal. And also yes you can light sounddeadener on fire with it.
It's still going to take some filler before painting.
Random guy: Why my engine is not starting?
I actually blew the screen when the smoke came up ðŸ˜‚
"""you mean to tell me removing 1 dent costs how much money?""... well let me tell you just how we do that now."
Not a chance on earth Iâ€™d trust that to lock the timing
"Ooorr.... you can just push from the inside, avoiding mess and tons of work. But hey.... body guys already know that?"
"There is a better system by Lenco. You weld washers on edge wise. Using a ""slide hammer"" with an ""L"" shaped hook you pull on the washers. I could ""metal finish"" from the out side. That means you could shave the tin with a body filler and spray primer.. plus you could use the same welder to apply patches or door skins or quarter panels..!!!!!!!!"
I need this in my life
Dude just twist em. They come right off no grinding
Thewaherbends you stillsol
So smart!
"This is ok to keep the cams in place, but don't try to use something like this to lock the cams for removing the mounting fasteners."
Dont be like me and grind at a panel only to figure out its aluminum ðŸ˜‚
I just know it would slip as I changed the beltâ€¦.. either that or Iâ€™d forget to take it outâ€¦. Screw it change the water pump while you are at it â€¦..
Always wanted to make a hell raiser/max style car with these all over lol

Wow.  1970?  80?  90? Paintless repair is where it's at today.  It's embarrassing to see someone put this on YouTube.

"You just have to be able to afford the stud welder, and afford a new paint job"
"can not be used on newer cars with hss and uhss . also they make wiggle wire that is far better and you use and tool head that pulls on them evenly.
do not use these on most newer mopar you will burn your durango down. also it burns off the corrosion protection on inside of panel. 
far better to push a dent out."
why not go PDR on it .. instead of this antique way
Umm not a single person thought that was special effects but alright
I could see someone forgetting to remove that.
Shit looks like the slag that gets in my everything
Boiling water and a plunger does the same job
Personally I prefer the inflated ball behind the panel trick
Bondo Billy would have just paved it up with filler
I dare ypu to try n start the car with that little bolt hooked up like that lol

Had guy at Chevy dealership burn down a car because pulled on the roof and forgot headliner was behind it. Also supposed to wait half hr after welding to make sure nothing starts smoking.
"Seriously, you're that clumsy and can't line up the marks without help? I mean if you wind up one tooth off it's not a big deal to skip it over so it will line up."
"In November 1998 I met the owner of Pop-A-Dent and he had the expertise to remove Dents in car bodies without removing paint or using the tool in this video, RIP Mr Denison you surely did some amazing dent repairs"
Thatâ€™s a lot of amps

"I think keeping the numbers for the mainline titles is probably the way to go. Whenever I've explained the series to someone it's a bit easier for them to understand if there's a number there of a subtitle as to what kind of game they're looking to play. That's not always true of course but as long as they get it that it's not a series that has to be played in subsequent order to understand they seem happy to figure out of the rest on their own. That said, Square has some odd things going on with numbers. Like they couldn't put in Fire5 for FF14 and instead did High Fire2. Not entirely sure where that comes from, but they didn't want the number to keep going up."

All the boycotts either way all seem performative to me anyway, everyone tweeting from their phone how virtuous they are, the phone with the battery courtesy of both child and slave labor.

"Final Fantasy Tactics (specifically WotL) is treated like a mainline game story-wise. Ivalice is a real world (XII, XIV) and was born in Tactics. If anything, Tactics is a point in favor of dropping the numbers. They called it Tactics because of the departure in gameplay style, but with the mainline games having a variety in styles now, it makes sense to drop the numbers. I would love to see each numbered game get a subtitle instead."

It just wont feel the same if you remove the numbers an simply use a title for it.

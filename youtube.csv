David Sch,Is this supposed to be creative? No hate  just asking

Ellinakias,That's fun creative and all but I like Vlad with a cigarette riding a stolen tractor taking you idk to Skopje to stay at a hotel where the staff are half drunk during the day and your bed sheets have bugs and theres also a used condom behind the closet for 10 euros a day   better
emretheripper,Omg 9:18 XD
Ferdzgrant Lopez,Your my favorite travel vlogger Pppeter 😁hope you enjoy your stay in the Philippines. Mabuhay!!   You are a very talented bro.  I hope you can have a video tour in the Philippines with Vlad hehehe...
FH360100211,Keep doing what you are doing  I love all of it man!
FlyingPolarbear,SORRY! I watched 5 minutes and skipped to the end.......... :(
Frederick Werk,I appreciate the creative side of the video and of course  the creator/artist should do what HE wants. Personally it kinda bored me this video and one of the reasons I watch this guy is for his story telling skills aka please talk.
Gangadhar Naidu Appineni,@pppeter  my only wish is to see you visit south india and especially hyderabad  what's stopping u  from taking this random comment and make you travel and meet me  a random subscriber and a big fan?
grace garcia,Welcome to the Philippines
Hackerman86,Hey Peter. I've been your fan and subscriber since you came out with the Casey Neistat video. I've watched every single one of your videos as soon as they came out and I've never been disappointed. Thank you for that. But this one here. This is a masterpiece. This is one of those rare videos that bring a tear to your eye from excitement and you can't put a thing on why exactly. This will be in my all time favourites from all of youtube and I know I'm gonna come back to it time to time. Great job man and I can't wait to see what's next :)
Harperr,the fact he didn't talk at all actually improved the quality alot because it was super unique and thats what i love about this channel
Hayley Igoe,Do you live in Philippines 🇵🇭 😮😮
Himani cooking,Not a big fan of this one old dirty style is much better
Huy Vo,If you ever come to Vietnam  don’t hesitate to inform beforehand
I LOVE GAY NEPAL,Bro go to indonesia 😁
Ilan Concepciòn,El video se siente diferente a lonque nos tiene acostumbrados el canal pero igual fue interesante ver como se hizo algo nuevo.
ItsMeKlaydessu,Dang  seeing my country PH at your video makes me overjoyed.
Jo Orme,Please talk  the hand thing is so annoying and so is the music. 😢
Joris Wessels,I got slapped… a lot
Junwei Low,I recognise your fans having an accent from my country Singapore 🇸🇬!!!! How lucky of them to meet you in Qatar and keep doing what you’re doing Peter!!
Karburators Benzīns,al lot better when you speak  couldnt watch this when i eat...
Kareem Mohammad,From marshal islands to Qatar ...what a plot twist ......I hope you a nice trip. But the next time COME TO EGYPT 🔫
Kartoffel Adonis,I love this style of video. The dedication off making these shots is insane.  But I always love your videos hope to walk into you one day like the two in the end. But I'm also constantly traveling the world so rather unlikely.  Keep it up inspiring people.
Kira oo,Hiya
Kos Anton,i stopped watching the moment she took out Qatar from the hat. So many beautiful small countries around the world for adventure and picked one of the most mainstream countries in the world to visit. This is just too paid off by sponsors video…
Kristian Sibarani,i love your adventure peter  I don't regret subscribing to your YouTube account  I'm very lucky to find it
Kristóf Karádi,He fell off
Lisa Alderson,I hated this format. I like to play your videos on the phone while I work  so the non verbal format doesn't work for me. Even when I stopped to watch   the writing on your arms was often not readable on the small phone screen. Plus I like your voice.
Louise L,Hoping to bump into Peter someday and take a photo with him while he's filming his vlog too! 😊
m ca,Excludes Europe and then lands in Qatar. What a message fate played on him. Europe has 1000x more adventure than Qatar.
MaeMae,Very creative and fantastic editing. Glad to see you try something new!
Mario Anderson,peter come to sri lanka
Marios X.,I love your traveling videos but.... TALKKKKK FFS
María Ferreira Ruiz,The hand thing became annoying after a while. Made me feel dizzy  I swear
Matt Smith,This video was so annoying
MATTHEW,bring back the series with vlad the worst of ….  this was nice
Matthew Gage,That editing style was fun. Cool experiment.
maximplus04,Interesting way to narrate a video. I gotta say though I definitely enjoy your videos were you talk instead of reading your hand.
MF,This was an innovative idea! And I love how humble you are with your subscribers. Never change man  keep pushing your creative limits!
Mg328i,I’ll be back once he goes to Mexico 🇲🇽
Mila Fedina,So  you screwed up with the tickets  and we all take the rap? :)) I've been hit in the forehead so many times by you!  I'm off.  OK  you knocked a good comment out of me: great video  thanks.  Good luck.
MilhoTV,😢 no please  no....
mizhomesiq,Omg the subscribers spoke English either in Singaporean or Malaysian accent. It's all too familiar coz I'm Malaysian.
nani onichan,Try to explore the Philippines more Peter  was so glad to see you arrive in my country.
O E,are the excessive transitions and the writing on the hand supposed to be ironic or serious? lol
Oblivion Lord,You've become boring to watch mate  non offense taken but your older content "worst reviewed" series was way better.   Less softcore  more hardcore
Orhun Kulacoglu,Amazing
Patrick Nintemann,Where did you start? I guess Micronesia? In this video  the editing is less hectic. That's good. But it's still pretty hectic. Just a little less then the last one. And the Camera punching is weird. The idea of randomly going somewhere is great tho.
Peregrino,Silence forces people to think and most people are not good at that.
Phoenix-Quenn Azula,After sexond Place in  Eurovision for Finland he traveling the world
Pradeep,9:09 Bro got the silent Rizz

Romana Amrichová,I used to love how you meet people  talk to them  get into crazy situations  try weird stuff  give us good old humor with sarcastic comments 🥲 really missing your old types of videos...
Ruohon Leikkaaja 57,You dipped your bracelet in the sauce in the end😅
S K,Dont try to copy Casey Neistat  i think we all prefered the classic pppeter and vlad humor
Sabog Na Ako,Wellcome to philippines!!.
Samuel Cruz,Bro i wished your connecting flight was on Davao City  another city in the Mindanaon Island. Those fans were lucky to catch and have picture with you.

Sm1l3k1ll3r,Keep twitching from all the camera slapping  pls dont do it another vid like this... like the creativity and all but it gets annoying
SOS dot GOLD ,Pppeter  ppplease visit Armenia 🇦🇲
Sotiris Kotronias,WAY TOOOOO much slaps with your hand  tiring to watch the video...find immidietally another way for your transitions.. It is also an old trick  out of fashion!
Spoonpoon,This entire video felt like an intro
Stefan,Did the Filipina airport staff really give you her number?
Stephan Doiron,I always thought the hand thing was dated and amateurish to be honest and this video takes it to a whole other level. Sorry PPPeter  not a fan of your travel series and really dislike the new editing style. I like you and want to see you do well but not a fan of this series  sorry  this is a skip for me.
Szoke Erik,speachless
